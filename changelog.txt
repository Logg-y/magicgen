NEW IN v2.0.0

Internally there is now support for event based spells. This means there are now some new additions, as well as groundwork for more...

Added global enchantment effects:
	Scaling gem generators (except for blood)
	A free patroller in every owned province in friendly dominion
	Drown the world in hungry animals that eat lots of supplies
	Generates good events based on dominion strength
	Various levels of finding extra magic items
	Various variations of random pathboost on mages/commanders/researchers
	Finds and generates mines and mineral deposits
	Scale modifying effects
	Global that grants XP to commanders
	Freespawn random summonable units (including the modifiers magicgen normally puts on things)
	Freespawn random summonable commanders

Lesser changes and fixes:
	Bowl of Blood now searches blood (it was nature, thanks r2 for this)
	Corrected the numbers in the UI description for the research modifier advanced option
	Spring immortality summon modifier now works
	Looming hell now applies the correct global effect, previously it was ghost ship armada
	Switched around vanilla gem generator globals' stats to fit in with the new scaling ones:
		Stellar focus research level reduced from 7 to 5.
		Mother oak research level increased from 5 to 6
		Eternal pyre research level increased from 6 to 7
		Gale gate research level increased from 6 to 7, gem cost increased from 75A to 80A
		Maelstrom research level decreased from 8 to 7
		Well of misery research level decreased from 8 to 7
		(Earth blood deep well and blood vortex are unchanged)
	Fixed a naming bug that caused creation to fail if messing with the research level adjuster.
	Added error checks triggered if generated unit/weapon IDs go beyond the limits that the game will accept
	Lowered path modifiers no longer apply to global enchantments
	Summon modifiers that make weapons magical can now be applied to weapons that are already magical
	Many minor spell name and description grammar fixes
	Rebalanced skipchances for most summons to make the new conjuration globals appear at a reasonable frequency
	Spells that tried to generate with a path level of over 9 now are set to 9, rather than the game being left to interpret their path level as 1 instead
	Units with secondshapes can no longer get the immortality summon modifier, as this would cause them to always return in their weakest shape regardless of what they died as (this primarily affects size 2+ elementals)
	Fixed error when specifically trying to generate mages for a nation that doesn't have any nationals
	Added yellow details text to murdering winter
	Added aim/wind guide precision spells because they somehow didn't make it in the first pass
	Added ranged modifier for non-commander summoning spells
	Added battlefield edge summoning spells
	Added cloud extension modifier for cloud spells
	
Balance:
	Cave drake remote attack creature count increased by 2 from 1/+1 to 3/+1
	Reduced the path level scaling rates for the following effects:
		Haste: -50%
		Rust: -50%
	Chain lightning fatigue cost 30 from 20, path level 3 from 2, research level 4 from 3 (thanks to the relevent testers for showing me why this was OTT)
	Fear range reduced from 50 to 25 + 5/level
	Crusher remote attack number of units increased from 1 to 3, cost per additional unit lowered from 250 to 100 fatigue
	Clayman remote attack cost per additional unit lowered from 50 to 20 fatigue
	Living statue remote attack spawns 4 less per cast
	Reduced the path level for astral corruption from 11 to 9
	Reduced the cost per additional effect of battlesummoned mages by 50%, making large summonings of them cost less gems to cast

NEW IN v1.2.3

Added a button to the UI that tries to autodetect good starting IDs based on the mods loaded.
Correctly noted the maximum number of modded weapons.
Fixed number of bolts in fires from afar description (thanks Mergele).

NEW IN v1.2.2

The interface now allows the input of various start IDs so that they can be chosen to not conflict with other mods in use.
Fixed the name of Kokythiad ritual summons when it has death as its primary path. 

NEW IN v1.2.1

Hopefully fixed an "invalid argument" error caused when trying to generate national spells when specifying mods.

NEW IN v1.2.0

Smites are now 100 precision as they are in vanilla.
The interface now offers a choice of the nations to generate national spells for. Now people who want to have large numbers of national spells on a small selection of nations can do so!

NEW IN v1.1.2

Earthquake now correctly requires E4 (was E2 due to a mistake on my part).
Slightly increased the cost of ritual summoned bukavac - I didn't see the AP tentacles when pricing these.
Ritual summon bishop fish will always generate.
Corrected the maximum level of the lowest tier of resist spells so that higher research, ludicrously priced versions don't appear with duplicate effects.
Mid tier resist spells can now generate a 100% battlefield version at research 9.
Life after death can no longer generate a self targeting version.
Projectile chain lightning base aoe reduced from 2 to 1
Nonprojectile chain lightning base level increased from 3 to 4
Fixed send to void to have a hard MR check as stated in the text (and intended), it was incorrectly offering an easy MR check

Added undead-only regen.
Added a twist fate and fools luck combination buff.
Noted that phoenix pyre also gives +5 fire resistance in an attempt to lower chain reactions.
Added regular and greater enlargement.

Summons with heat aura are now prefixed "hot" instead of "infernal" to better distinguish them from the inferno banishment effect.
4 gem in battle spells now have the correct base cast time of 225%.
Path level increase per research for mistform reduced from 0.66 to 0.33.
Wave warriors scale rate increased slightly to make battlefield wide generate at research 8.
All drain life effects now have 50% skipchance. Due to the large number of different but very similar drain life effects, these were very prevalent at high levels.
Skipchance for range 10 and 3 spells now 90%, from 70%.
Introduced name variety to reduce the number of spells with the same name at different research levels. National spells aren't affected by this though.
Renamed a few spell effects to accommodate the above naming scheme.
Blight now gets a proper description when generating with earth primary path.
Slightly increased fatigue scaling for fascination. This has only a significant impact on higher level variants.
Spell scaling now rounds up. This shouldn't make much visible difference in most cases, however.

Updated data files (base units) to 5.51, this means that sea stags will generate with the newly corrected weapon
Prevented various data fields being filled with decimals.
Prevented storm power, vine arrow and bonds of fire from playing a sound effect which starts a new instance of the ingame music.
Fixed the crossbreeding ritual so it actually works now.

"Unending" chain lightning scaling rate inreased by 50%.
Foulspawn and greater foulspawn rituals made higher research and have higher path requirement, they were previously WAY too strong.
