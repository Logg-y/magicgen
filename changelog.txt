NEW IN v1.2.0

Smites are now 100 precision as they are in vanilla.
The interface now offers a choice of the nations to generate national spells for. Now people who want to have large numbers of national spells on a small selection of nations can do so!

NEW IN v1.1.2

Earthquake now correctly requires E4 (was E2 due to a mistake on my part).
Slightly increased the cost of ritual summoned bukavac - I didn't see the AP tentacles when pricing these.
Ritual summon bishop fish will always generate.
Corrected the maximum level of the lowest tier of resist spells so that higher research, ludicrously priced versions don't appear with duplicate effects.

Life after death can no longer generate a self targeting version.
Projectile chain lightning base aoe reduced from 2 to 1

Path level increase per research for mistform reduced from 0.66 to 0.33.
Wave warriors scale rate increased slightly to make battlefield wide generate at research 8.

Skipchance for range 10 and 3 spells now 90%, from 70%.
Introduced name variety to reduce the number of spells with the same name at different research levels. National spells aren't affected by this though.
Renamed a few spell effects to accommodate the above naming scheme.
Blight now gets a proper description when generating with earth primary path.
Slightly increased fatigue scaling for fascination. This has only a significant impact on higher level variants.

"Unending" chain lightning scaling rate inreased by 50%.
Foulspawn and greater foulspawn rituals made higher research and have higher path requirement, they were previously WAY too strong.
