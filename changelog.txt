unique summons
a flag that makes spells always cost gems under all circumstances for magic explodes style generations
check mind hunt to see if I can add that back
try ritual soulless animation as it looks like it should work

test a bit of everything, esp modular events

v2.1.4:

ADDITIONS:

Added an option to scale the cost of blood rituals
Added options to allow not clearing vanilla generic and/or national spells (thanks Megu for providing the national spell list here!)
Telestic animate summons (both ritual and in battle) have made a return - somehow these escaped the initial summon pass
Added a modular global effect that spawns bad events in the affected provinces
Added a ranged swallowing spell for nature
Added a global that transforms sitesearching friendly commanders inside dominion
A spell that permanently shrinks targets
Added various variations on farstrike that go with other paths
Added various (but uncommon) effects that permanently add some kind of ability to the caster
Added a soulless-raising ritual

NEW SUMMON MODIFICATIONS:

Power of the turning year
Invisibility
Formation Fighter
Unsurroundable
Enlargement and shrinkage
Teleportation
False army
Far caster
Inspiring researcher
Fortune Teller
Fixed forge bonus (1 only)
Temp gems for appropriate paths
Pearl cultivator
Carcass collector
Fast casting
Corpse eater


CHANGES:

The recuperation and glamour summon modifiers now have name prefixes (thanks Arcvasti)
Fire ants, firebirds, killer mantis, and salamanders no longer make the howl noise when summoned in battle
Heat aura is no longer cast off script to eliminate the risk of unfortunate and unexpected burning
Most mages are now given some value of #indepspells, which lets them use spells up to the listed research level. By default, most chassis' spell lists are hardcoded and perhaps upsurprisingly removing generic spells caused them to have nothing to cast. The values given are an attempt to keep to vanilla power. This will increase generation time considerably if BaseU.csv is changed.
Increased the default montag size multiplier to 2.0. This means that summoning globals spawn a wider variety of units.
Increased the chassis value of most summoned mages. This should have little to no effect visible effect on generation, but was necessary for the enlargement modifiers
Unit descriptions are now cached in memory. This decreases generation time somewhat
Modular globals should now be split more evenly across research schools rather than being disproportionately skewed towards alteration, and to a lesser extent enchantment
Added an explicit battlefield wide version of most buffs. This is to make full battlefield buffs be generated more frequently again. This also meant I could reserve certain sound effects for field wide versions (such as Luck)
Changed national spell generation logic to better fit national mages (thanks to the person who submitted nearly all the code for this who I believe still wants to remain anonymous)
Opened up many modular global effects to other paths. This is for the sake of variety!
National mages for vanilla nation now includes specific terrain and cap only recruits

DETAILS (yellow text) IMPROVEMENTS:

Burden of time now lists the chance to age units - it is (41 + 4*death scale)%
Added for bonds of fire (morale + DRN > 21 to escape, 3 AN fire damage when this happens)
Added for false fetters (MR + DRN > 20 to escape)
Added for slime (MR + DRN > 21 to end)
Added details of marking and attacks for Dome of Corruption
Added for Astral Corruption
Added for growing fury
Added for bleeding
Improved Looming Hell (there is actually a hidden chance that means it can attempt more than 5 units per turn)
Improved for Fata Morgana (50% chance to hide all units, otherwise multiply the number by 0-5)
Corrected greater horror seed base penetration (actually 15, text said 16)

FIXES:

The weapon modifiers bestowing multiplicative damage, partial life drain, granting the AP modifier, or reanimating as soulless no longer apply to weapons which did not do standard damage to begin with. These effects would otherwise cause these weapons to inflict the altered damage type instead of their original function.
Transformation global enchantments can no longer affect immobile commanders
Summon modifiers with conditions now check against all of the unit's alternate forms as well
Fixed the typo that made 100% of battlefield lightning bolt generate at any research level instead of 13 only
Consistently prevented blood spells that do not cost slaves talking about blood sacrifice
Corrected some rounding issues in montag weight calculations, which would result in the total weight displayed being inaccurate and the percentages for each unit not summing to 100%
Fixed monster boar spells retaining their national ties
Fixed a bug that caused the prefix applying code to not apply to spells that share names with vanilla spells
Fixed a bug that caused generation to enter an infinite loop
Fixed shatter working on non-inanimates as well
Fixed blood fecundity applying dome of corruption instead
Fixed in battle corpse construct summons generating without a path that provides undead leadership
Fixed glamoured unit modifier's research penalty being +1 research (allowing more powerful creatures) instead of -1 (weaker)

v2.1.3:

Switched to building executables with cx_Freeze rather than PyInstaller - this means the output gets a few additional bits and pieces but otherwise should be functionally identical
Added nations.csv to the distribution - I don't quite know how I managed to miss this, but it would likely cause issues somewhere


v2.1.2: Fix for astral harpoon effect ending up in construction


NEW IN v2.1.1: Remote summoning nerfs

This mostly concerns balance for remote assassinations and attacks. Pricing things by eye was always going to be a mess, and sure enough it absolutely was one. Before this things had only been changed following game usage: the stuff here is a result of not terribly comprehensive testing, aimed at making the effect/cost ratio a lot more consistent. At the very least, these spells are much more likely to now be bad rather than absurdly overpowered.

The idea here is that ~8 gem remote attacks should be able to take 6pd somewhat reliably. Due to scaling, high pathed casters can probably achieve more, but getting high path casters is not something that is necessarily easy.

Additions:

Astral Harpoon's effect (complate with descriptive yellow text!), for 5 gems.

Text improvements:

Noted the actual chance for lab explosion on dome of flaming death (10% plus/minus one per misfortune/luck scale in the province where the dome is)
Made lure of the deep's yellow text clearer.
Added the 10% curse chances to horror seed's yellow text
Added details (yellow text) to plague and soul vortex that explain exactly what they do
Added the actual gold created by Celestial Rainbow (it's 300 + 4d100+)
Added the actual number of wolves summoned by howl
Added the interaction between snowstorms and grip of winter
Added the percent of the battlefield hit by relief

Balance:

Changes to very nearly every remote attack and assassination

NEW IN v2.1.0: Revisiting Evocation and Nasty Globals

Having seen even low level evos delete entire squares of fully armoured stuff, it seems a few things need to be turned down some. Test games seem to be showing that it's currently best to pretend buffs no longer exist, so it seemed something needed to be done about that.
When buffing them this was always going to be a possible issue, but based on test games it seems that might have been somewhat excessive... 
These numbers still result in evocation generations with power somewhat over vanilla, but not what they used to be.


Additions:
	Added various offensive global enchantment effects. The system that makes these is modular and generally applies a chance to do bad things to all provinces across the world, including the caster's.
	The conditions and effects are matched at random to create a spell of appropriate strength.
	Possible conditions:
		Flat chance per province, always checked (affects commanders at random)
		Prevented by any mage of the same path as the spell (affects commanders at random)
		Any commander is patrolling
		Any commander is researching
		Any commander is preaching
		Any commander is site searching
		Any commander is blood hunting
		Any commander is calling god
		Any commander is constructing a fort
	Possible effects (note that gods are not valid targets for any effect that affects a commander):
		Scale alterations
		Add unrest
		The commander is the victim of an assassination attempt
		The commander becomes diseased
		The commander becomes cursed
		The commander becomes blinded
		The commander gains a limp
		The commander loses an eye
		The commander suffers permanent weakness
		The commander gains battle fright
		The commander gains a chest wound
		The commander becomes crippled
		The commander gains a never healing wound
		The commander becomes mute
		The commander becomes shrunken
		The commander gains a horror mark
		The commander loses an arm
		The commander becomes banished to another plane
		The commander becomes transformed into a bad physical shape
		The commander suffers some amount of AN poison damage
		

Balance:
	Mass plague research level increased from 9 to 11. I have not seen this in use but testing shows it would murder everything...
	Scaling direct casted plague max research level increased accordingly from 8 to 10.
	Plague summon modifier research level penalty increased from -3 to -6. I didn't realise this effect didn't come with a MR check(!)
	Fireball damage reduced from 18/2+ to 9/2+, base research increased from 1 to 2
	Cold projectile damage reduced from 21/3+ to 9/2+, is now AP
	Acid projectile damage reduced from 14/2+ to 9/2+
	Falling frost AoE reduced from 3/1+ to 0/1+, base research reduced from 4 to 2, scale rate reduced from 8 (!) to 1, damage reduced from 18/2+ to 6/2+, is now AP
	Falling fires AoE reduced from 3/1+ to 0/1+, base research reduced from 4 to 2, scale rate reduced from 8 (!) to 1, damage reduced from 10/2+ to 6/2+
	Acid Rain AoE reduced from 3/1+ to 0/1+, base research reduced from 4 to 2, scale rate reduced from 8 to 1, damage reduced from 10/2+ to 6/2+.
	Banefire fatigue cost per additional AoE increased.
	Vine arrow research level reduced from 2 to 1.
	Damage done by instant rain of stones spells reduced by 2.
	Added some x% of battlefield evocations, weakened from their normal damage as follows:
		Falling fires (2/1+ AP): 25% at research 7, 50% at 8, 100% at 10
		Falling frost (2/1+ AP): 25% at research 7, 50% at 8, 100% at 10
		Acid rain (2/1+ AP): 25% at research 7, 50% at 8, 100% at 10
		Lightning bolt (2/1+ AN): 5% at research 7, 10% at 8, 25% at 9, 50% at 10, 100% at 13
	Halved the spawn chance of research 6+ freespawn globals.
		
Changes:
	Generated mods now have a description indicating what version of MagicGen they were made with.
	Combat spells of other paths are 50% less likely to appear in blood.
	Montags with duplicate creatures now no longer list the same creature twice
	Creatures put into montags without modification now instantly transform into their original forms rather than remaining the special, newly modded version
	Added rather heavily detailed (but still incomplete) yellow details text for horror seed
	Added the chance of ending up in the void from returning effects (7%)
	
Fixes:
	Mineral Transmuation no longer generates with astral or blood as a secondary path
	Fixed the logic that sometimes caused overpowered modifiers to be assigned to low level globals
	Fixed the logic that was causing single path globals to get secondary effects of a myriad of random paths
	Globals now no longer try to assign modifiers to montags, causing mother ghuls to appear.
	Corrected Twiceborn #damage value, previously it applied twist fate


NEW IN v2.0.3

Additions:

Changes:
	Added yellow text to spells that summon exploding units to list the area of effect outside of the inspector.
	Units with disease explosion now gain 100% disease resistance.
	Poison projectile evos now scale AoE like other evocations (rather than number of projectiles).
	Summons (or other spells with high number of effects) that would have obnoxiously high gem costs now proportionally reduce the number of effects along with the gem costs.

Balance:
	Slightly increased cost of ritual summoned bane, bane lord and shura commanders.
	Increased fatigue cost of the explode-on-death summon modifier by ~50%

NEW IN v2.0.2

Balance:
	Offensive secondary effects can no longer apply to low level large AoE nondamaging spells. This means that things like mass rust can no longer come with secondary burning or decay at research levels as low as 3!
	Specifically, the maximum base AoE allowed is 3*((L(L+1))/2) where L is the research level of the spell.
	
	Longdead horseman remote attack reduced by 3 flat units and 1 per caster level

NEW IN v2.0.1

Changes:
	All remote summons are now a LOT rarer. This means your conjuration trees should get filled up with things other than tons and tons of remote anonymous summons. National spells are still fair game for these, however.
	Fixed the autodetect IDs button (the addition of event codes and montags broke this)
	More robust mod file parsing that should hopefully crash less!
	GUI crashes now try to write a error text file which might be helpful when mod parsing goes bad again

Unintentional behaviour fixes:
	All sea dog rituals can now be cast on land. Previously, only the battle summon could be
	Poison barbs summon modifier now correctly applies poison barbs and not poison skin

Balance:
	Khalkhotauros remote attack research level up to 7, no longer spawns extra per caster level
	Spring hawk remote attack spawns -2 hawks per cast
	

NEW IN v2.0.0

Internally there is now support for event based spells. This means there are now some new additions, as well as groundwork for more...

Added global enchantment effects:
	Scaling gem generators (except for blood)
	A free patroller in every owned province in friendly dominion
	Drown the world in hungry animals that eat lots of supplies
	Generates good events based on dominion strength
	Various levels of finding extra magic items
	Various variations of random pathboost on mages/commanders/researchers
	Finds and generates mines and mineral deposits
	Scale modifying effects
	Global that grants XP to commanders
	Freespawn random summonable units (including the modifiers magicgen normally puts on things)
	Freespawn random summonable commanders

Lesser changes and fixes:
	Bowl of Blood now searches blood (it was nature, thanks r2 for this)
	Corrected the numbers in the UI description for the research modifier advanced option
	Spring immortality summon modifier now works
	Looming hell now applies the correct global effect, previously it was ghost ship armada
	Switched around vanilla gem generator globals' stats to fit in with the new scaling ones:
		Stellar focus research level reduced from 7 to 5.
		Mother oak research level increased from 5 to 6
		Eternal pyre research level increased from 6 to 7
		Gale gate research level increased from 6 to 7, gem cost increased from 75A to 80A
		Maelstrom research level decreased from 8 to 7
		Well of misery research level decreased from 8 to 7
		(Earth blood deep well and blood vortex are unchanged)
	Fixed a naming bug that caused creation to fail if messing with the research level adjuster.
	Added error checks triggered if generated unit/weapon IDs go beyond the limits that the game will accept
	Lowered path modifiers no longer apply to global enchantments
	Summon modifiers that make weapons magical can now be applied to weapons that are already magical
	Many minor spell name and description grammar fixes
	Rebalanced skipchances for most summons to make the new conjuration globals appear at a reasonable frequency
	Spells that tried to generate with a path level of over 9 now are set to 9, rather than the game being left to interpret their path level as 1 instead
	Units with secondshapes can no longer get the immortality summon modifier, as this would cause them to always return in their weakest shape regardless of what they died as (this primarily affects size 2+ elementals)
	Fixed error when specifically trying to generate mages for a nation that doesn't have any nationals
	Added yellow details text to murdering winter
	Added aim/wind guide precision spells because they somehow didn't make it in the first pass
	Added ranged modifier for non-commander summoning spells
	Added battlefield edge summoning spells
	Added cloud extension modifier for cloud spells
	
Balance:
	Cave drake remote attack creature count increased by 2 from 1/+1 to 3/+1
	Reduced the path level scaling rates for the following effects:
		Haste: -50%
		Rust: -50%
	Chain lightning fatigue cost 30 from 20, path level 3 from 2, research level 4 from 3 (thanks to the relevent testers for showing me why this was OTT)
	Fear range reduced from 50 to 25 + 5/level
	Crusher remote attack number of units increased from 1 to 3, cost per additional unit lowered from 250 to 100 fatigue
	Clayman remote attack cost per additional unit lowered from 50 to 20 fatigue
	Living statue remote attack spawns 4 less per cast
	Reduced the path level for astral corruption from 11 to 9

Hopefully fixed an "invalid argument" error caused when trying to generate national spells when specifying mods.

NEW IN v1.2.0

Smites are now 100 precision as they are in vanilla.
The interface now offers a choice of the nations to generate national spells for. Now people who want to have large numbers of national spells on a small selection of nations can do so!

NEW IN v1.1.2

Earthquake now correctly requires E4 (was E2 due to a mistake on my part).
Slightly increased the cost of ritual summoned bukavac - I didn't see the AP tentacles when pricing these.
Ritual summon bishop fish will always generate.
Corrected the maximum level of the lowest tier of resist spells so that higher research, ludicrously priced versions don't appear with duplicate effects.
Mid tier resist spells can now generate a 100% battlefield version at research 9.
Life after death can no longer generate a self targeting version.
Projectile chain lightning base aoe reduced from 2 to 1
Nonprojectile chain lightning base level increased from 3 to 4

Added undead-only regen.
Added a twist fate and fools luck combination buff.
Noted that phoenix pyre also gives +5 fire resistance in an attempt to lower chain reactions.
Added regular and greater enlargement.

Summons with heat aura are now prefixed "hot" instead of "infernal" to better distinguish them from the inferno banishment effect.
4 gem in battle spells now have the correct base cast time of 225%.
Path level increase per research for mistform reduced from 0.66 to 0.33.
Wave warriors scale rate increased slightly to make battlefield wide generate at research 8.
All drain life effects now have 50% skipchance. Due to the large number of different but very similar drain life effects, these were very prevalent at high levels.
Skipchance for range 10 and 3 spells now 90%, from 70%.
Introduced name variety to reduce the number of spells with the same name at different research levels. National spells aren't affected by this though.
Renamed a few spell effects to accommodate the above naming scheme.
Blight now gets a proper description when generating with earth primary path.
Slightly increased fatigue scaling for fascination. This has only a significant impact on higher level variants.
Spell scaling now rounds up. This shouldn't make much visible difference in most cases, however.
Middle and high tier resist spells now scale significantly faster.

10% casting time effect research modifier for nonhostile spells increased from +3 to +4
Added 16% cast time modifiers. This is to go between 25% (4 spells per round) and 10% (10 spells per round), sitting at a happy medium of 6.25 (thanks Arcvasti for the suggestion)
Updated data files (base units) to 5.51, this means that sea stags will generate with the newly corrected weapon
Prevented various data fields being filled with decimals.
Prevented storm power, vine arrow and bonds of fire from playing a sound effect which starts a new instance of the ingame music.
Fixed the crossbreeding ritual so it actually works now.



NEW IN v1.1.1

"Unending" chain lightning scaling rate inreased by 50%.
Foulspawn and greater foulspawn rituals made higher research and have higher path requirement, they were previously WAY too strong.
