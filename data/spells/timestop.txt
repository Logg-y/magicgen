#name 16 "Time Stop"
#descr 16 "This powerful alteration will slow down time to almost a standstill for everyone but the caster. Any ongoing effects like regeneration or heat clouds will also be slowed down, regardless if they affect the caster or not."
#details "The caster's in battle delay decreases at ten times the rate. Battle and sound playback is slowed by 90%. Innate spellcasters may insert non-scripted spells in between their scripted spells. Lasts half a round, enabling the caster to act as if they had five rounds of actions in this time."
