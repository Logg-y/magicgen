#descr 1 "The caster heats part of the armour of SUBJECT, causing it to warp and distort. This does not harm the %victim%, but may damage or destroy PRONOUN_POS armour."

#descr 8 "The caster causes fractures in the armour of SUBJECT, causing it to become damaged. This does not harm the %victim%, but may damage or destroy PRONOUN_POS armour."
