#descr 1 "The caster heats part of the armour of SUBJECT, causing it to warp and distort. This does not harm the %victim%, but may damage or destroy PRONOUN_POS armour."
#descr 4 "The caster cools part of the armour of SUBJECT, causing it to warp and distort. This does not harm the %victim%, but may damage or destroy PRONOUN_POS armour."
#descr 8 "The caster causes fractures in the armour of SUBJECT, causing it to become damaged. This does not harm the %victim%, but may damage or destroy PRONOUN_POS armour."


#details "Rolls DAMAGE+DRN vs 0+DRN (or 10+DRN if the armour is magical). Success damages the armour (-20% protection). Damaging already damaged armour breaks it (-50% protection). Armour conferred by magic items is completely unaffected."
