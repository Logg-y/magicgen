#descr "This spell is imbued with strange energy that may petrify those affected."
#details "Affected creatures make an easy MR check. Those that fail to resist are petrified for 22500-45000 ticks, in which time they are immobilised, have defence skill 0, have their natural protection increased to 20 and are granted Slash and Pierce resistance. They must make a MR check vs 13 or die when reverting to their original form. Stone beings, such as living statues, are immune to the spell."
