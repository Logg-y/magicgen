#descr "This spell is filled with a dark energy that may cause those affected to begin bleeding profusely."
#details "Affected creatures make an easy MR check. Those that fail to resist begin bleeding: Bleeding creatures suffer HP/20 damage per round, and gain 10 fatigue. The chance of bleeding stopping is (10 + regeneration percentage)% per turn, halved if underwater. Ethereal units will always stop bleeding without suffering any adverse effects."
