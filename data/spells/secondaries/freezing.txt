#descr "A sudden and intense burst of cold may cause those affected by the spell to become frozen."
#details "Affected creatures make an easy MR check. Those that fail to resist become frozen: Frozen creatures suffer -3 to attack and defence skill, have halved combat speed and attack rate, and take 2d6 fatigue damage per round. Thawing chance per round is 25% - (cold resistance + (6*cold scale)), to a minimum thawing rate of 25%. Having 5 or more cold resistance, a cold aura, being undead, having mistform, or being ethereal prevents the effect."
