#descr "This spell is imbued with earthen energy that may rip the armour off those affected."
#details "Creatures in the area when the spell is cast make an easy MR check. Those that fail to resist may have their armour damaged: roll 8+DRN vs 0+DRN (or 10+DRN if the victim's armour is magical). Success damages the armour (-20% protection). Damaging already damaged armour breaks it (-50% protection). Armour conferred by magic items is completely unaffected."
