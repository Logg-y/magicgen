#descr "This spell may also transform the body of those it affects into a fine mist."
#details "Affected creatures make an MR check. Those that fail to resist gain mistform: Any damage is reduced to 1 (max 25 points of reduction). A hit that would have dealt 25+ damage, or a hit from any magical source, cancels the mistform after the damage reduction. There is also a 1% chance that the enchantment will expire whenever protecting against an attack."
