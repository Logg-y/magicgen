#descr "This spell is infused with dark magic that might slightly shake the confidence of those it affects. This effect alone is very unlikely to cause any creature to flee in terror."
#details "Creatures in the area when the spell is cast make a hard MR check. Those that fail to resist suffer minor fear, temporarily lowering their morale. This effect is virtually unable to force victims to make morale checks on its own."
