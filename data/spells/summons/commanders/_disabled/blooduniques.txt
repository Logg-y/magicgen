Winged and powerful, they lead the armies of the Inferno. They wield terrible weapons and can use their barbed tails to lash out at enemies, but it is their skill with Fire magic that makes them truly fearsome. Arch Devils radiate heat and are impervious to flames. Once an Arch Devil dies, it returns whence it came and can be summoned once again."
