#name 128 "Crossbreeding"
#descr 128 "Hundreds of different creatures from mice to humans are magically cross-bred and grown in an effort to produce a powerful monster. Most offspring die early, but some survive and are bound to serve their creator. Luck is required to breed the more powerful creatures."
#details "The caster's Adept Crossbreeder value is added to the number of effects. Each crossbreed has a (((Luck * 5) + 17 + Adept Crossbreeder)/10)% chance to be a strong crossbreed, otherwise it is a weak crossbreed."
