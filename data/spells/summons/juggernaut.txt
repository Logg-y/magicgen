#descr 16 "The caster builds a massive structure of religious significance in a remote province and powers it with astral magic. The resulting juggernaur then attempts to trample over a hostile commander. Regardless of whether it is successful in the resulting conflict, it crumbles to inert metal soon after and has no effect on the faith of the province, despite its power."
