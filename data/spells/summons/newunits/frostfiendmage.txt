#setstr descr "Frost fiends are devils of the icy reaches of the demon realms. In the constant wars of Inferno, the frost fiends are feared by all fiery devils. They wear robes of woven ice and are constantly surrounded by an icy wind. They wield ice rods and can unleash blasts of infernal cold upon their enemies. They can only be summoned if human blood has been sacrificed. Their powers increase in cold lands. Frost Fiend Iceweavers are usually users of blood and water. Some have gained skill in other paths of magic, such as dabbling in mist, the Void, or horrific crossbreeding experimentation."

-- Design intent: Big water mage, with chance at something else useful on top
-- but unless you have All The Blood you probably aren't going to be able to afford to fish these randoms for something you really want
-- feels a bit weird going light on the blood here, but I guess that's what the spine devil is for
