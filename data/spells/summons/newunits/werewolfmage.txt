#setstr descr "Most werewolves are cursed with lycanthropy. Some werewolves called skinshifters have voluntarily taken wolven form with the aid of a wolf skin. All werewolves regenerate. Despite their lycanthropy, any magical knowledge from their past form is retained. In fact, the process of transformation is often especially revealing about the facets of Nature, and occasionally the magic of the other seasons."
