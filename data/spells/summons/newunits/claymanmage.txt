-- Design intent: Guarantee a w2e2 mage. I would have done w1e1 100% we but it's really hard to justify buying that
-- F randoms will be too rare to fish for actively but nice if you get lucky
-- Making claymen seems like a neat thing for a magical clayman to be able to do, so why not? Not terribly useful unless you're sitting on/in a fort or something though
