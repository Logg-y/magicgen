#setstr descr "Spine devils are spine-covered demons summoned from the Abyss with human sacrifice. The spines covering their bodies are poisonous and anyone attacking them with short weapons may get pricked and poisoned. They usually fight with two venomous claws, but their practitioners of Blood magic instead favour magic staffs."
