-- Design intent: Guarantee a a2d2 mage, any less and why would you cast this
-- Other randoms will be too rare to fish for actively but nice if you get lucky
-- Rejects can at least make more constructs or something, it's not exactly good but it's something I guess

#setstr descr "A construct made from the body parts of several dead humans, it is reanimated by channeling lightning through its body. The corpse construct resembles a soulless but is larger and stronger. Anyone striking it in melee risks getting affected by the high energy running through the construct. This construct is possessed by a spirit that was killed by being struck by lightning, allowing it to perform some magical tasks. Additionally, it can produce three mundane corpse constructs by itself every month."
