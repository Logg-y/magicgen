#setstr descr "Vine men are strange beings composed of vines, roots and moss. They resemble humans but are totally mindless. They live in deep forest thickets and do not venture far unless summoned by magic. This is especially the case for those possessing magical ability: whilst their primary focus is Nature, some to explore the magic of the other seasons."
