Phantasmal pyromancers are not mages in their own right, and they project their false 'spells' at enemies. As these too are illusionary, they harm only those who believe them to be real. As they are not truly casting spells, their imitations do not fatigue them, nor can they be interrupted. As they are not living, phantasms may travel underwater; however, their 'spells' are useless underwater as it is trivial to understad that fire magic does not burn underwater."
