#details "Freezing: Frozen creatures suffer -3 to attack and defence skill, have halved combat speed, and take 2d6 fatigue damage per round. Thawing chance per round is 25% - (cold resistance + (6*cold scale)), to a minimum thawing rate of 25%. Having 5 or more cold resistance, a cold aura, being undead, having mistform, or being ethereal prevents the effect."
#descr 4 "A SIZE area is frozen. This will cause creatures caught within to quickly become exhausted, though cold resistance and heat scales will cause them to thaw faster. Some creatures can never be frozen such as ghosts or beings that radiate heat."

This will cause creatures caught within to quickly become exhausted, though cold resistance and heat scales will cause them to thaw faster.
