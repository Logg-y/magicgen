#descr 128 "$BLOOD_INTRO$, the caster sends ARTICLE %horror% to invade the %mind% of SUBJECT. Horrors incited by this spell are infectious, and gradually spread their influence to other units in the same province. The secondary horrors spread only horror marks and curses and do not replicate further, but they will cause the unit to burst into a lesser horror after some time. If the unit housing the primary infectious horror is slain, a greater horror is instantly released to wreak havoc on the battlefield."
