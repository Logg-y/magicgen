#name 64 "NAMEPREFIX Tongue Pull"
#descr 64 "The caster's tongue suddenly grows to immense proportions and rapidly lashes out towards a target. The magical tongue attempts to physically attack its victim. If this is successful, the tongue attempts to ensnare and rapidly pull the target into their mouth, swallowing them whole. Only victims smaller than the caster may be swallowed."
#details "Initially inflicts untyped AP magical damage, MR check for half damage. Inflicting damage triggers the swallowing portion of the tongue, which does not affect those larger than or the same size as the caster. This can be resisted by making a defence skill check against 3d6 (exploding), not including penalties from fatigue or modifiers from weapons. This spell does not confer any digestive ability, and those swallowed will remain inside the caster until combat ends (at which point they die) or the caster is killed (which triggers their release)."
