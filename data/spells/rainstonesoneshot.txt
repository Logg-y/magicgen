#descr 4 "The caster creates a brief shower of incredibly violent hail over a SIZE area. Being in the area tends to result in getting hit in the head by hailstones. Due to the speed at which the hail strikes, victims are caught by surprise and shields are no defence. More powerful casters can create larger hailstones."
