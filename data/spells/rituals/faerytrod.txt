#name 64 "Faery Trod"
#descr 64 "The mage leads his army into a magic forest to find a Faery Trod. The army follows this strange path through faery lands and will finally arrive in a distant forest. Both the source and destination provinces must be forests for this spell to work. Navigating on the faery paths is a tricky adventure and the mage may not emerge where they planned."
#details "Chance of ending up in a neighboring forest province: 50% if completely surrounded by forests, 0% if no neighboring forest provinces."
