-- #descr 1 "Catharsis was once the spirit of the Purifying Flames. He would cleanse bodily sicknesses of those who exposed themselves to his flames. Since his corruption by the Daevas and the wicked Mainyus he no longer controls the Purifying Flames and any powerful fire mage can wield his flames. With this ritual the caster sets himself ablaze on a pyre of Purifying Flames. The flames burns away any diseases he carries, but the caster is likely to suffer terribly from the flames unless properly protected."
