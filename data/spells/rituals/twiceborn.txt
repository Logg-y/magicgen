#name 32 "Twiceborn"
#descr 32 "With this ritual, the necromancer enchants his own body to protect himself from death. If the necromancer is slain, he is revived as a Wight Mage in the province where the ritual was cast, possibly gaining dark insights in the process. For the ritual to work, the province it was cast in must be in friendly hands when the necromancer dies. This spell requires more power to affect large beings and the cost of casting the ritual is increased with the caster's size. Undead, demons, plants or inanimates cannot be twiceborned."
#details "When the caster dies, he returns as a wight mage at the location where the spell was cast. If the lab is not under the caster's control, he is unable to return and dies normally. There is a 20% chance of gaining +1 death magic, to a maximum of 4. Being killed by a soul slaying effect prevents this effect from working. Reforming one's body in this way may heal afflictions in the same manner as a recalled Pretender.\n\nThe wight mage form varies depending on the unit's resource size, which is unaffected by size modifiers and typically reflects the size of a creature's body without wings or mounts. The first matching criteria below will determine the form of the returning mage.\n\nIf the caster is a recruitable unit or hero of Ur or Uruk, they become an enkidu Wight Shaman.\nIf the caster is a recruitable unit or hero of Ashdod and size 4+, they become a Wight Murmurer.\nIf the caster is a recruitable unit or hero of EA or MA Agartha and size 4, they become a Wight Oracle.\nPanic Apostates become Carrion Lords.\nIf the caster is a recruitable unit or hero of Asphodel and size 2, they become a Carrion Lady.\nIf the caster is a recruitable unit or hero of Asphodel and size 3, they become a Carrion Lord.\nIf the caster is size 2, cold blooded and has swamp survival, they become an undead C'tissian.\nIf the caster is size 6, they become a tartarian appropriate to their gender.\nIf the caster is size 4+, is aquatic or fully amphibious, they become a large undead Atlantian.\nIf the caster is size 2 and innately flying, they become an undead Caelian.\nIf the caster is size 5, they become a tartarian appropriate to their gender.\nIf the caster is size 4+ and female, they become an undead Gygja.\nIf the caster is size 4+ and male, they become an undead Skratti.\nIf the caster is size 2+, they become an undead human.\nIf the caster is size 1, and not innately flying, they become an undead Vaetti appropriate to their gender.\nOtherwise, they become an undead Zotz."
