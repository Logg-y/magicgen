#name 16 "Imprint Souls"
#descr 16 "The people of a small village in a remote province will have their minds gradually broken down. When they are entirely lobotomized, their minds will be imprinted with religious zeal towards the rightful Pretender God. When the conversion is complete, they will attack the province in an attempt to conquer it and serve their God to the best of their abilities. This is a very dangerous process, many people die and most of the survivors are not fully restored with the proper religious zeal. A skillful mage and extra penetration skill from magic items will help in successful conversion of the villagers."
