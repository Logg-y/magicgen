#descr 16 "This enchantment alters the fate of the entire nation, making lucky things more likely to happen. Provinces within the god's dominion have a small chance to summon a lucky spirit which persists invisibly for three months. During this time it increases the chance of something fortunate happening to the province it is in. The chance of a spirit appearing increases with the strength of the god's dominion."
#descr 128 "Through immense blood sacrifice, otherworldly powers are called upon to make good events happen. Provinces within the god's dominion have a small chance to summon a lucky spirit which persists invisibly for three months. During this time it increases the chance of something fortunate happening to the province it is in. The chance of a spirit appearing increases with the strength of the god's dominion."
#details "There is a SCALEAMT% chance per point of dominion to spawn a lucky spirit in a province. This process is entirely silent, but each lucky spirit has a 20% chance per turn to generate a good event. Spirits persist for 3 turns. Spirits will not appear in hostile provinces."
