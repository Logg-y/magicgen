#name 16 "Wish"
#descr 16 "This ritual taps the primal powers from beyond the Spheres. By projection of his own will upon the Principle of Beginning, the caster can affect the very processes of creation and receive an answer to his wish. There are many things to wish for, but the outcome is not always good. If you want something good and safe, you can try wishing for an artifact or magic gems."
#details "A non-exhaustive list of possible wishes:\n\n<Any creature name, excluding horrors>: Creates the named creature. If multiple creatures have this name, the one with the lowest ID is created. If the creature is unique and already exists, it is teleported to the caster's province under its original owner's control. If the creature is unique and has died, it is reborn under the caster's command and retains commander status if it had it before. Otherwise, created creatures are not commanders.\n<Any item name>: Searches for the named item to try to remove one copy of it. First, commanders are searched in random order. If the item was not found, search all players' treasuries in random order. The named item is then equipped on the caster, or put in the caster's treasury if that is impossible.\n'gems': 25 gems of all types, but no slaves\n'magic power': +1 to all magic paths of the caster except holy, even those they had no skill in before, to a maximum of 10\n'armageddon': Every province on the map loses 20% population. Each unit has a 20% chance to be struck with 15 untyped AP magic damage. Damage inflicted this way is not attributed to the caster.\n'horror', or any named horror: Summons a random doom horror. There is a 50% chance that it instead attacks the caster. If all doom horrors are already on the map, a random greater horror is summoned as a commander instead.\n'kill <nation name> pretender': The named nation's pretender is hit struck for 50 AN shock damage, then 25 hits, each inflicting 12 nonmagical damage with a defence check to negate (defence skill without weapon modifiers vs 3d6 exploding, victim wins ties). Finally, if the victim is not mindless, they are struck with a MR-negates attack which inflicts 999 magic damage with +5 penetration. The caster's penetration bonus is ignored, and this is an Astral effect for the victim's MR check. Damage inflicted by all of these attacks is not attributed to the caster. The caster is notified if the victim survives."
