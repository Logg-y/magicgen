#name 16 "Wish"
#descr 16 "This ritual taps the primal powers from beyond the Spheres. By projection of his own will upon the Principle of Beginning, the caster can affect the very processes of creation and receive an answer to his wish. There are many things to wish for, but the outcome is not always good. If you want something good and safe, you can try wishing for an artifact or magic gems."
