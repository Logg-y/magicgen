#name 64 "Transformation"
#descr 64 "The caster is transformed into a random monster or animal. Some monsters, such as fire drakes, are closely attuned to an element or other magical path. If the caster successfully transforms into such a being he might gain magic power. Also the casters new body is young and healthy. The transformation is not without risk, however, as the caster's mind and body may be damaged in the process. Sometimes a failed transformation can result in the form of a mindless being and usually mind and magic abilities are lost as a result. But sometimes a being with powerful magic can retain his magic ability as the magic is too strong to let the absence of a mind stop it."
#details "The caster transforms into a young monster, but lost limbs are still lost after the transformation. If cast under water the transformation results in a water being. The chance of transformation failure is 20% plus the misfortune scale in the province. Succeeding the first transformation results in a good outcome. Failing this causes the same check be rolled again. Failing the first and succeeding the second results in a bad transformation, which feebleminds the caster if the new form is not mindless. Failing both checks results in death."
