#name 64 "Transformation"
#descr 64 "The caster is transformed into a random monster or animal. Some monsters, such as fire drakes, are closely attuned to an element or other magical path. If the caster successfully transforms into such a being he might gain magic power. Also the casters new body is young and healthy. The transformation is not without risk, however, as the caster's mind and body may be damaged in the process. Sometimes a failed transformation can result in the form of a mindless being and usually mind and magic abilities are lost as a result. But sometimes a being with powerful magic can retain his magic ability as the magic is too strong to let the absence of a mind stop it."
#details "Undead or inanimate creatures are not affected by this spell. The chance of a good result is (80 + luck scale)%, where misfortune scales increase the odds of bad results. If a bad result is rolled, there is then another (80 + luck scale)% chance to survive. Failing both rolls results in the caster 999 true damage.\n\nIf the caster rolls a bad result and the chassis they transformed into is not mindless, they become feebleminded."
