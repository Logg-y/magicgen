#descr 16 "This mighty enchantment absorbs magical energies worldwide to replenish the caster's magical resources. Half of all magic gems used to cast spells and to create magic items will be absorbed into the Arcane Nexus and converted into astral pearls at a two to one ratio. The purity of Astral and Blood magic makes it impossible for the Nexus to absorb any magic when these types of spells are cast, but all other types of magic will have some of their power absorbed by the Nexus. Even when no spells are cast or no items are forged, the Nexus will absorb some ambient magic energy from the world."
#details "Each turn, generates pearls based on the number of gems (not including blood slaves and astral pearls) spent on forging and rituals that turn. Does not give income on the turn it was cast. The amount of pearls gathered is (openended d10 + 4 + total spent) / 4, rounded down."

#descr 128 "This horrible ritual is the cause of Blood magic being banned in ancient times. With an awesome sacrifice, the fabric of astral space becomes tainted with blood. All spell casting uses the tainted Arcana and attracts the attention of Horrors. Every time a non-Blood magic ritual is cast or a magic item is forged, there is a chance that a Horror will follow the arcane flow and attack the mage."
#details "Dramatically increases the impact of most horror-related activities, but does not stack with the Cataclysm. This includes the chance to upgrade horror types to a stronger version, the chance for horror marked commanders to be attacked, and the chances of the Eater of Gods and Hunter of Heroes attacking Pretenders and commanders in the Hall of Fame, respectively. Additionally, non-mindless commanders that perform rituals and forging gain a chance to be attacked. This effect scales with number of gems used. Rituals from items are not safe from this effect.\n\nFORGING AND RITUALS\n\nForging that includes two different gem types is evaluated twice, separately for each gem type. Blood slave costs in forging are ignored. Blood rituals are also unaffected. The attack probability is approximately ((mage's horror marks * 20) + 1 - Drain scale + number of gems spent) / 35.\n\nHORROR MARK ATTACKS\n\nCompared to normal game state, the chance of attack is multiplied by 10.\n\nHUNTER OF HEROES\n\nRarku becomes able to attack non horror marked heroes. As in a regular game state, checks proceed in order of increasing commander ID, at most one commander can be attacked this way each turn. As with the regular game state, both the 32.5% chance to consider a commander in the Hall of Fame and the additional 10% chance to attack anyone else with a heroic ability with present. The chance of an attack following consideration in percent becomes (2 + marks * 4), to a maximum of 20% at 5 or more horror marks.\n\nEATER OF GODS\n\nUmor becomes able to attack non-horrormarked non-mindless Pretenders. As in a regular game state, checks proceed in order of increasing nation ID, and at most one Pretender can be attacked this way each turn. There is a 50% chance to consider each pretender in turn.

The song of the vortex is heard by all mortals in the world, whispering sweet melodies of death and carnage, beckoning all people to come bask in its crimson presence. Its song is especially strongly felt by those whose blood is suitable for blood rituals, summoning them to the site of the ritual. The mortals that enter its presence stare dumbfounded on the waves and swirls in the vortex, or throw themselves heedlessly to drown in the bloody swirls. The master of the ritual then collects suitable victims to use in other rituals. Eventually, when no life is left in the world around the vortex, it dries out and dies. Provinces with strong influences of order will be less affected by the beckoning and those with strong turmoil influences will be more drawn to the vortex."

Two of these checks pick any province on the map at random, the third always selects an adjacent province to where the spell was cast. These provinces contribute (population/200) + d50 (exploding), to a maximum of (population/10). If the province does not have turmoil 2 or 3, this is divided by two. If the province has order 2 or 3, this is divided by two again. Twice the number of people that are contributed this way are deducted from the province's population. Underwater or provinces with no population are not valid.\n\nThe local province also contributes (population/100) + d100 (exploding), to a maximum of (population/10). Scales have no impact unlike remote provinces, but population is still deducted.\n\nThe final amount of slaves gained is equal to (local contribution + total remote contribution + closed d10)/9, rounded down."

#descr 16 "This mighty enchantment enables the caster to project his mind to many distant places at once, via strands of arcane power. While projected, the caster will only be able to sense and affect magic, but this still makes it possible to search for magic sites and enemy mages. The caster will be able to project himself into all provinces that have a friendly Dominion. Magic sites are more elusive when searching in this way and a very powerful mage is required to find those that are well hidden. Mages are usually able to stay hidden from the projected mind if they have a good magic resistance value. If an Astral mage is found, a battle of the minds will ensue. Only one will leave it with their mind intact. Non-astral mages cannot try to retaliate, but neither do they risk losing their sanity in the process. However, they will be subjected to a minor Mind Burn attack if they are found. If the caster becomes feebleminded the enchantment will dissipate."
#details "Site searching: In each province that is owned and under friendly dominion, for each path the caster has, roll an exploding d10 and add the caster's path level. Search the province according to the die result:\n\n21+ - search at level 3\n16+ - search at level 2\n11+ - search at level 1\n\nEach turn, every hostile non-mindless mage in the caster's dominion must make a MR check, unaffected by the caster's pen boosters or Astral level. If they succeed this, nothing further happens to them.\nIf they are not an astral mage, they are attacked with 10 AN magical damage, with another MR roll to negate it. This MR roll does use the caster's penetration bonus from items, and adds (their astral level/2) rounded down to the penetration value. Damage inflicted this way is not attributed to the global caster, and will not trigger Blood Vengeance or similar effects, nor do enemies killed this way add to his kills stat.\nIf they are an astral mage, both parties roll (their current astral level) + closed d6. The caster of this spell wins ties. The loser becomes feebleminded."

Illusory creatures that are hostile to the caster struck for 999 AN magical damage, with a MR check to avoid the effect.

The Hunt is led by Herne the Lord of the Hunt, an ancient deity of the wild roaming the woodlands in search of those who have offended the wild and its inhabitants. When the Hunt has been called, powerful priests of enemy faiths will be hunted down for as long as the Lord is not slain."
#details "The Wild Hunt targets enemy priests located in forest provinces.\n\nHerne the Lord of the Hunt targets land forest provinces. He will preferentially target the enemy priest with the highest holy magic level found in forests, even if they are sneaking, and is somewhat biased towards low province IDs: this is due to searching in increasing IDs with a 50% chance to skip over any given province. He will only attack the first valid commander he finds. Herne himself attacks victims in assassination settings. He is a E1N5 mage with 2 nature and 1 earth gem, is scripted to cast spells, and is equipped with an Enchanted Spear, Wall Shaker, and Amulet of Resilience. He is always accompanied by 12 Barghests and 17 Wolves, and his retinue of 6d6 Black Dogs. Should he lose an assassination battle, the spell will end and the enchantment will fade.\n\nThis spell also spawns lesser attacks. Unlike Herne, these select land forest provinces entirely at random, and will always attack the nonsneaking hostile priest in the selected province with the lowest commander ID. This makes 210 attempts: failing to find a commander to attack consumes 1 attempt, and successfully attacking a commander consumes 51 attempts, meaning that there are a maximum of 5 such attacks per turn. A single commander can be attacked multiple times by lesser attacks. The failure of a lesser attack does not reduce future attacks, nor does it result in the enchantment ending.\n\nLesser attacks are comprised of one of following, at equal chances. All die rolls are openended.\n\nBarghest commander, 1d6 + 4 Black Dogs\nCu Sidhe commander, 1d4 + 2 Cu Sidhe\nDire Wolf commander, 1d10 + 10 Wolves"
