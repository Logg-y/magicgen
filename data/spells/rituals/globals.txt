Half of all magic gems used to cast spells and to create magic items will be absorbed into the Arcane Nexus and converted into astral pearls at a two to one ratio. The purity of Astral and Blood magic makes it impossible for the Nexus to absorb any magic when these types of spells are cast, but all other types of magic will have some of their power absorbed by the Nexus. Even when no spells are cast or no items are forged, the Nexus will absorb some ambient magic energy from the world."

The song of the vortex is heard by all mortals in the world, whispering sweet melodies of death and carnage, beckoning all people to come bask in its crimson presence. Its song is especially strongly felt by those whose blood is suitable for blood rituals, summoning them to the site of the ritual. The mortals that enter its presence stare dumbfounded on the waves and swirls in the vortex, or throw themselves heedlessly to drown in the bloody swirls. The master of the ritual then collects suitable victims to use in other rituals. Eventually, when no life is left in the world around the vortex, it dries out and dies. Provinces with strong influences of order will be less affected by the beckoning and those with strong turmoil influences will be more drawn to the vortex."

#name 1 "The Kindly Ones"
#name 64 "The Kindly Ones"
#descr 1 "The caster unleashes the Erinyes upon the world. The Erinyes are three horrible spirits of vengeance that punish those who slay innocent women. In elder times, they upheld the ban against Blood magic, but they have since returned to the darkness whence they came. They are sometimes called the Eumenides, the Kindly Ones, but their true names are Avenger of Murder, Grudging Anger and The Unrelenting One. Sinners will hear the horrible baying of the sisters and madness will strike them unless they are found and most gruesomely slain by the sisters. The first sister kills those who have killed many people, the seconds one hunts those who use blood magic and the third one hunts people at random. The Kindly Ones remain in the world until the enchantment is dispelled or the three of them are slain."

#name 128 "The Looming Hell"
#descr 128 "Devils will appear in the dreams of some unfortunate enemies whenever they try to sleep. These Devils, through various threats, will try to persuade their victims to sell their souls and join in the killing of their own commander. The strength of the threats depends on the strength of the God's Dominion, but extreme courage is always required to defy the Devils. The Devils are totally powerless if they are unable to persuade any victims, which may well happen should the enemy commander be more feared than they are."
#details "Up to 5 random enemy units inside the dominion will be offered to sell their souls. They get a Morale check vs 10 + dominion to resist (4 easier to resist if their commander has fear)."
