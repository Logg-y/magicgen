#name 16 "Astral Projection"
#descr 16 "The caster's mind is separated from his body and travels the Astral Planes in search of military information. His mind and body are connected with a silvery cord, which can be detected by unfriendly Astral mages. Once detected, the cord of the mage can be severed - a traumatic experience indeed. Each casting of this ritual allows the mage to scry on one province. The use of extra astral pearls increases the duration of the ritual."
#details "This is a scrying spell, but the caster's astral cord may be severed by hostile astral mages. Each turn the enchantment is in effect, each hostile astral mage in the target province has a (40 * astral level)% chance to feeblemind the caster, which will also end the enchantment. The nation owning the mage that detected the scryer is notified of the scryer's name."
