#name 16 "Astral Projection"
#descr 16 "The caster's mind is separated from his body and travels the Astral Planes in search of military information. His mind and body are connected with a silvery cord, which can be detected by unfriendly Astral mages. Once detected, the cord of the mage can be severed - a traumatic experience indeed. Each casting of this ritual allows the mage to scry on one province. The use of extra astral pearls increases the duration of the ritual."
#details "Duration: 1 month + 1 / extra astral pearl. Astral cord detection chance = 40% * enemy mage's astral level."
