#name 1 "Barrage of Embers"
#descr 1 "The mage fires a row of flame bolts towards an enemy army camp located in a province far away. The more units present in the camp, the greater the chance of hitting a target. The spell can also be used to harass a besieging force or the defenders of a castle. A scout or a scrying spell will be required to see whether the spell was successful or not."
#details "There are EFFECTIVENREFF bolts. The chance of each bolt hitting is 20% or (25 * number of units in the targeted province)/number of bolts, whichever is higher. Those who are hit suffer 7 points of armor-piercing fire damage, plus one per level of fire magic. The caster will not get a report on the results of the attack without a spy in the province."
