Commanders that are inanimate that are not already one of the three kinds of mummies produced by this spell are not valid targets.\nIf the unit has a resource size, consider that. Otherwise, use a unit's regular size.\nIf the unit is size 3 or smaller, and innately flying, return as a Caelian Mummy.\nIf the unit is size 4 or larger, return as a Giant Mummy.\nOtherwise, return as a Mummy.\nIf the hero was a prophet, and another prophet has since been appointed, the returned mummy loses its prophet status, but retains its holy magic."
