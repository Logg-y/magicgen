#details "Affected targets become petrified for 2250-4500 ticks, in which time they are immobilised, have defence skill 0, their natural protection increased to 20 and are granted Slash and Pierce resistance. They must make a MR check vs 13 or die when reverting to their original form. Stone beings, such as living statues, are immune to the spell."

#descr 8 "The caster temporarily turns creatures within a SIZE area to stone. There is no resisting this effect. Instead of reverting to their original form, petrified creatures may crumble to dust."
