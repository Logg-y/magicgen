#descr 16 "SUBJECT is rapidly teleported to the capital fort through a rift in space. Whilst travel should be instantaneous, there is a chance that any creature brought along will become lost in the Void. Being lost will result in attacks from otherworldly creatures, and possibly insanity. If the capital's fortress is controlled by an enemy, this results in certain death."
