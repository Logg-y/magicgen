#descr 256 "With this prayer the priest draws upon the power of his God to fill a hostile undead creature with holy energy. If the target fails to resist, the energy makes the target explode violently in an eruption of holy fire. The divine fire badly burns nearby undead, and due to its divine nature, neither armour nor fire resistance offer any protection."
