#details "The lightning will pick a random target within a radius of 1 square, if there are any. If there are not, it can travel up to total Euclidean distance of 2 (rounding down results) in search of another target. It cannot hit the same target twice in a row, and will stop prematurely if there are no valid targets in range."
