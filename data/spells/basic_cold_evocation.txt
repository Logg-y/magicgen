If the defender loses this roll, they become petrified for 22500-45000 ticks; becoming immobilised, having their defence skill set to 0, their natural protection increased to 20 and gaining Slash and Pierce resistance. They must make a MR check vs 13 or die when reverting to their original form. Inanimate or stone beings cannot be petrified this way, though they may still be harmed by the other components of the spell."
