#newmodifier "Strong Spell at Lower Research w/ gemcost"

-- This used to be both evo and buff...
-- Half the intention of this is to give people tools to fight off certain dominant blesses
-- at the cost of having to throw gems at the problem

-- ... unfortunately people employing typical rainbow blesses would get buffs that would turn their sacreds up to stupidity
-- limiting it to offensive effects also means that the sacred user can potentially gembait/evobait their way out of some of these

-- so this is evo only now
