#descr 128 "This spell will bring the ultimate protection for SUBJECT in battle. Whenever PRONOUN is wounded, the damage is transferred to the one who tried to wound him. Magic resistance might prevent this from taking effect, so the mage is not fully invulnerable. This method of protection is also rumored to be used by some of the most powerful and magically attuned beings."
#details "Any non-true damage that is less than 9000 may be reversed to the damage dealer, so long as the damage dealer is alive and the damage is not self inflicted. The damager must make a MR check vs +1 penetration (which ignores the caster's penetration bonuses). This is considered a Blood effect for the damager's magic resistance check. If they fail, they take true damage equal to the amount of damage that would have been inflicted. This redirected damage is AN, and rolls DRNs on both sides."
