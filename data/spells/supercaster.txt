-- This can be revisited if there is a way to polymorph in battle into a unit with ID over 1000
-- technically this could be achieved by making use of the unused IDs but that suddenly adds
-- compatibility excitement and requries more groundwork for an issue that should not even be
-- an issue in the first place!

-- Turns out (from code diving) that aoe 1 will prevent this from happening
-- hence burning everyone else in the same square to a crisp

#details "Transforms the caster into a spirit of unbound flame, inflicts decay and soul slay, and removes all of the caster's fatigue. This spirit has homesickness, spreads unrest, is useless for forging, rituals and researching, and gains a horror mark every turn. In exchange, this form boosts the caster's Fire magic by 1 while lowering all other paths by 1. Additionally, the spirit has 50 reinvigoration and casts spells at double speed. Any items held by the caster are dropped as if the caster died in the battle. Additionally applies twist fate, swiftness, fire shield, phoenix power, and blood surge. Anyone who is not the caster in the same square is killed by the released power."

#name 1 "Blazing Transformation"
#descr 1 "This spell is the last resort of the fire mage. Upon casting the spell, the mage's body and anyone standing immediately beside him are ripped asunder by the magical power released, causing the mage to instead appear as a being of pure fire. His ability in fire magic is greatly increased and he becomes very resistant to fatigue, but in this state he will quickly wither and die should he survive the battle. Additionally, his ability to cast spells of other paths is diminished."
