The Qedesot are female Avvite temple servants. They are chosen for appearance rather than intellect. Although ordained as priests, their main function is another. Rephaim are allowed to use and be blessed by the Qedesot for a small fee. All Rephaim are male and as only the Qedesot can bear them new sons, they have higher status than their male counterparts and sometimes lead small groups of Rephaim.
