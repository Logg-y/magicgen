In the beginning of time, the first humans lived in scattered tribes serving different gods. Three gods of remarkable powers gave their blessings and lore to their servants. There was a great war among the gods and the servants of the three gods waged war on the world. Only when the Pantokrator intervened was the threat thwarted and the three gods imprisoned for eternity. Their servants suffered a similar fate and were entombed in the under-earth. Their prisons have been sealed for millennia, but powerful mages sometimes try to break the seals to release and bind these servants of the imprisoned gods. The passage of time has turned their bodies to stone and their weapons of bronze have fossilized and merged with their bodies. They are hard as stone, but somewhat brittle.
