When the Basalt Queens died, the Mothers of the Deep succeeded them as religious leaders of the Atlantian society. Huge and ancient, they wield the holy power of their God. They alone remember the ancient rites and traditions of the Basalt Queens and don't allow any lesser priests but their chosen Consorts. They seldom leave their coral temples unless accompanied by Mother Guards. The Coral Queens are ancient Atlantians of the deeps, recognizable by their dark skin.
