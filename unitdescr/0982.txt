A clockwork horror is a spring-driven, automated nightmare. It has the appearance of a small, copper human with piston arms that end in scythes. The spring of the clockwork horror is wound up before battle and the horror is released close to the front of the battle and pointed at the enemy. The clockwork horror then, with speed driven by its magical springs, whirs across the battlefield towards the enemy ranks. If everything goes as expected, the clockwork horror will use its scythes to tear into the enemy ranks, all the while accompanied by the horrible ticking of its internal clockworks. Fortunately, the springs and clockworks powering the clockwork horror will only allow for a short burst of frantic slaughter before they need to be wound up again.
