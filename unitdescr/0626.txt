The Fallen Angel was an angelic being that revolted against the Divine Order and was imprisoned in the Inferno. Released from its prison by Blood magic, it has been given a chance to serve a new God of the Terrestrial Sphere. The Fallen Angel is a powerful user of Fire, Death and Blood magic. It has lost its priestly powers, but is fanatically loyal to its new master and is sacred in his Dominion.
