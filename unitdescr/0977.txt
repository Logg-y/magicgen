When the Empire fell, the remaining Augur Elders were banished from Sceleria together with the Sauromancers who taught them their dark arts. However, a few of the C'tissian mages were admitted into the Order of the Thaumaturgs and were instrumental in the containment of the evil. Since those days, there has always been a small group of C'tissian Thaumaturgs in the order. Zirru is the last of these lizard mages. His skills are undisputed and he would, had he not been a lizard, probably have been High Thaumaturg.
