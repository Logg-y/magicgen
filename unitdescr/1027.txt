A Carrion Lord is a dead Pan reanimated and given unholy powers by a Panic Apostate, who forces the soul of the dead Pan to rejoin its own moss-covered carcass. The carcass is entwined with vines and roots that have a life of their own. The Carrion Lord is a powerful wielder of Nature magic, but is also given unholy powers over the dead. The Carrion Lord can create manikins by animating vines, roots and the bones of dead beasts.
