The Scorpion King is a spirit of destruction and terror given divine powers by a previous Pantokrator. The beast was placed as a monstrous guardian of the path to immortality beyond Mount Mashu. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator, the beast has claimed the secrets beyond Mashu and arrived to wreak destruction and havoc upon the world. The Scorpion King is a hideous and twisted being with the body of a huge scorpion and the upper torso of a scaly human. It is a mighty beast capable of striking simultaneously with its scorpion stinger and any forged weapons it may carry.
