Farbaute is a fierce warrior. He is almost impervious to pain and is skilled in the two-weapon combat of the Einheres. Farbaute's drinking habits are legendary and it is reputed that he won a drinking contest in Jotunheim against the much larger and swill-swollen giants. Because of his friendly ways with the giants of Jotun, he has made several enemies among the Vanir, but the Einheres and humans of Vanheim consider him a true hero.
