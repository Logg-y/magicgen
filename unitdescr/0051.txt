When a noble lady gives birth to an illegitimate daughter she has the opportunity of redeeming herself by giving her daughter away to the Theurgs of the Great Cathedral to become trained as a priestly maiden. From the age of six they are trained in battle and athletic sports otherwise restricted to men. When they reach maturity they are inaugurated as priestesses and given their first spear. They carry no armor, relying on their quickness and faith to avoid their enemies' weapons.
