During the civil war, the Keep of Ulm was laid under siege. Starvation held a hand of iron over the remaining Guardians. When the Malediction hit the kingdom, the Hunger of the besieged Guardians became ravenous and unholy. Feasting upon their dying comrades, they survived the siege, but cursed themselves for eternity. In the ruined Keep, they still live and exercise their military code, ready to march if called by the Lord of Ulm. They use ancient Blacksteel armor but have removed the visors of their helmets to let onlookers behold their hideous visage. They wield ancient Black Halberds imbued with divine might that strikes heretics with exhaustion.
