The Abysians are a race of hellish humanoids with magma bodies. They radiate a furnace-like heat and are impervious to all forms of fire, but are vulnerable to cold. The chill of winter slows them down and lowers their morale. Abysian infantry uses heavy iron armor and heavy weapons that will not burn away in their smoldering hands.
