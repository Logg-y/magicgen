The Magnificent Kingdom of Ind has many subservient lands. Among them is Great Orionde, a forest kingdom ruled by noble men who have tamed the wild forests and their inhabitants. Great Orionde is a subservient kingdom allowed to keep their hereditary kings and there is no Viceroy of Ind to rule the land. In service to the Prester King Great Orionde fields great armies of knights and crossbowmen. The nobles and knights of the land spend their time honing their skills or hunting half-men in the forests. A noble that can't display at least one satyr at his dining table is likely ridiculed by his peers.
