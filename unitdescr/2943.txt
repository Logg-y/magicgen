Once there was but one Ensi, the priest-king of the First City. But as new cities were founded Eridu lost influence and the leaders and founders of the new cities claimed Ensi-hood and religious authority. With time the Ensi of the First City became but one of several petty kings of equal power and authority. Now there is an Ensi priest-governor for each city state. Rivalry between the cities has occasionally led to times of strife, but so far no Ensi has managed to conquer all of the other city states. With the imminent arrival of the Awakening God the Ensis have set their differences aside and Uruk has become a united nation once more.
