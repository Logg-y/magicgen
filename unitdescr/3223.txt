The Cyclopes have abandoned their pastoral ways of life and form a warrior-caste formally ruling Phlegra. While mankind toil and serve, the Cyclopes live as masters of the kingdom, reminiscent of the Gigantes of Mekone. They occasionally wage war upon inferior races, but most of their time is spent honing their skills and bullying the human population. The Cyclope Commanders claim that they are the equals of the Mekonean generals of old, but in truth their success in battles stems from the strength of their soldiers rather than from their strategic skills.
