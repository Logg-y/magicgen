Scabiel, the Maker of Ruins, is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. The Maker of Ruins has emerged in the world several times in history and wreaked havoc and leveled all the cities of entire continents. It has strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack beings previously marked by Astral magic.
