Master Smiths are responsible for the production of weapons and armor in Ulm. They instruct lesser smiths in the forges and enhance the armies of Ulm with their magical skills. Fear of magic is common in Ulm and as a result, Master Smiths are the only ones permitted to use magic. Recently this has led to a controversy with the emerging Iron Order. Some smiths have turned to the new cult, but most of them have tried to ignore the Black Priests. Because Ulm has few magical resources, Master Smiths have learned to create magical items very efficiently, thus requiring fewer magic gems to forge them.
