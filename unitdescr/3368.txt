The Bronze Colossus is a huge bronze statue that has come to life from being worshiped for centuries. When the Pantokrator disappeared its bronze body became animate and people found new hope. The Colossus is mindless and mostly does what its worshipers believe it would do. It punishes harshly and rewards sparingly.
