This wise man was once the General of the East in the old Pantokrator's armies. After the General of the West had almost been slain, the Pantokrator became worried. As a precaution, he granted his general a divine body so that he would not easily be slain. Now that the Pantokrator has fallen, the general who calls himself the Celestial General is out to become the new God.
