There are several races of giants in the land of Hinnom. The Horim are the first inhabitants of the land. They are untouched by the legacy of the Grigori and have lived apart from the Rephaim and Avvim for ages. When the Avvim prospered, the Horim retreated to remote mountain areas and deep caverns. There they met the Pale Ones of Agartha and war broke out. The Pale Ones were clearly better adapted to a life in darkness and soon the Horim were forced to leave the depths. The Horim are slow of mind and have not mastered any skills useful in the art of war. They might be predecessors of the cavemen found scattered in remote mountain areas. The Horim mostly live in caves and use crude weapons of wood and stone. They have remarkable strength and endurance and can survive in most climates.
