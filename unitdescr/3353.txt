Jinnun are spiritual beings born from Smokeless Flame in a distant past. They replaced the Hinn and Binn during the reign of a previous Pantokrator. They are naturally invisible and ethereal, but can take physical form when they wish to interact with men. Once, the Jinnun lived in Ubar, a magic desert kingdom of marvelous riches, but when magic dwindled, they scattered and Ubar was forgotten. There are many Jinn races with different abilities and powers, but they are all born from Smokeless Flame and therefore ethereal and invisible, unless they wish to be seen.
