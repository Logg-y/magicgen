The Rusian society is divided into two moieties. Both humans and Chudes either lead their lives as nomadic hunters and warriors, or in small settlements. Marital traditions demand that no one marries within his or her own moiety. Apart from the betrothal and marriage ceremonies the two moieties have limited contact, and Chud hunters have more in common with their human counterparts than with the Chudes of the other moiety. Chud Hunters mainly use spears and javelins as weapons. They are skilled but undisciplined warriors, endowed with the gifts of the sacred bear. If wounded they will fight with unquenchable rage. Chud Hunters reputedly eat their meat raw.
