The Ilah is a giant of divine heritage. A previous Pantokrator made him guardian of the mountain around which the sun revolves. When men encountered the Sacred Mountain they were led by a serpent to its summit. Here they were approached by the Ilah and they began to worship him as a God. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the Ilah for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Ilah will return to rule the world from the mountain at the center of All.
