Deep in the Smouldercone, the Warlocks of Abysia experiment with their brethren to create superior beings. The Demonbreds are the most successful of these creatures. Part demon, part Abysian, they share the strengths and weaknesses of both. The Demonbreds are bound by their nature to serve their masters as slaves. Trained as assassins, they deliver death to the enemies of their Warlock masters. Demonbreds radiate the hellish heat characteristic of Abysians.
