The Jann are half-breed descendants of the Jinnun of Ubar. Gifted with the spiritual might of the Jinnun and the strong physique of the 'Adites they are superior to men in every way. The Jann form the ruling caste of Na'Ba and most of them live secluded lives in marvelous palaces carved out of the enchanted cliffs of Ubar. While most Jann live comfortable lives served by slaves there are some who pursue a martial career. These mighty warriors defend their Queens and Jannah, 'the Garden', the last of the miracles of Old Ubar. Unlike the Jinnun of Ubar the Jann have physical form, but they can hide their true appearances and are able to fool lesser men with illusions and tricks of the mind. Jann, like their Jinnun ancestors, take great discomfort from the touch of iron and use armaments and weapons made of bronze.
