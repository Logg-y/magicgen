Aboleths are ancient beings sprung from the depths of the ocean. They resemble huge, mud-crawling fish with tentacles and large, dark eyes covering their foreheads. The Giboleth is a young Aboleth that has survived its spawn age and grown independent of its Polypal Mother. It has begun to shed its scales, but its hide is still thick and dark. The Giboleth is beginning to develop the strength of mind characteristic of the race and it can project its will on lesser beings. Should it survive for some centuries, it will shed the last of its scales and become a full grown Aboleth, able to dominate other beings. A Giboleth fights with the strength of its mind and its tentacles.
