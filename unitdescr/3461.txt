Tubbas, human priest-kings, take advice from their Unseen masters, and rule the ruins of Iram awaiting the return of the Lords of Ubar. When the Gates of Brass have been opened, Tubba priest-kings will be appointed as governors over lands conquered by the Lords of Ubar. The title Tubba, One who Follows the Sun like a Shadow, comes with great authority, and he is endowed with magical powers far beyond those of mortal men. The Tubba is often accompanied by a Qarin, an invisible Jiniri companion that aids him in research and other endeavors, and grants him health, wealth and a long life. The Qarin might also appear in battles to protect him from harm.
