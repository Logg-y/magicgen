The Priests of Phlegra are caretakers and shepherds of the human population. While the Cyclope and Tyrant rulers of the kingdom have little use for the worship of gods, the humans pray for deliverance from the wrath of the Laestrygonians. Phlegran priests travel throughout the land to comfort the human population and give them hope that the Laestrygonians remain imprisoned in their mountain ranges.
