The Teotl is a giant of divine heritage. During the reign of a previous Pantokrator he was the Beast of the Night, released by his master to feed on the wicked and the weak. After having eaten thousands and thousands of hearts, he grew in malice and in power. His master became worried and imprisoned the Beast for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Beast of the Night has returned and his hunger has grown during his millennial imprisonment.
