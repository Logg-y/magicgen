The people of T'ien Ch'i have always been obsessed with physical health and long life. Masters of the Way quest for immortality through internal alchemy and asceticism. Other less esoteric alchemists try to uncover the alchemical properties of the Five Elements inherent in all matter, living and dead. These alchemists are skilled herbalists and are able to cure diseases. Their skills and exposure to alchemical ingredients has given them limited longevity and resistance to many poisons. The Alchemists of the Five Elements are skilled at alchemy and receive a bonus when gems are alchemized into gold.
