The Obsidian Warriors are sacred elite warriors of the Xibalban Zotz. With the disappearance of the Ah K'in and the solar cult, darkness and the deeper earth have become the focus of the cult led by the Chilanob. The obsidian crafting of earlier times, perfected by the Bacabob, has allowed a select few to be armed with enchanted weaponry. Most of the obsidian arms are made for the Wo' Muuch, but the will of the Awakening God has made it clear that the sacred warriors of the dark must be armed as fitting for a warrior of the Lord. The Obsidian Warriors now serve the Chilanob as a powerful strike force armed with divine favor and enchanted weaponry.
