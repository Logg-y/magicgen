Once the kings of Arcoscephale were guided by astrologers, but with the death of the Great Conqueror all astrologers were slain by his successor for failing to predict the outcome of the military campaign. With the purge of the astrologers, the need for spiritual guidance became evident. At this time the Sibyls appeared. The Sibyls are ancient seeresses of great skill who emerged to give guidance to the kings and generals of the crumbling empire. No one knows where they truly come from, but their oracular answers have restored Arcoscephale as a power to be reckoned with.
