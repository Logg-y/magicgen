The Vampire Queen is an ancient sorceress who has changed her very essence by imbibing the sacrificial blood of virgins. This vile act has granted her the power of immortality and now she is claiming godhood, too. Once during each winter she will gain a couple of new Vampires to serve her. Vampires are totally unable to enter underwater provinces.
