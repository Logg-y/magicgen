The Triton Princes are Tritons of semi-divine heritage. While not as gifted as the Triton Kings, they still command great respect among the Tritons of Pelagia. They lead the Knights of the Deeps. They are of royal blood and trained from birth to become exceptional generals and warriors. Their hippocampus mounts have healing powers similar to those of the unicorn.
