When Berytos fell the Phaeacians kept many traditions including matriarchy. The former Brides-in-Waiting called themselves Colossi Queens and abandoned the blood magic of the Melqart cult. They reigned in Phaeacia until the Gigantes came. When Nausithous' Gigantes settled on Black Korkyra the Phaeacians declared war upon the Gigantes to protect their lands. The Gigantes were few and were losing. Nausithous yielded and offered himself in marriage to the Colossi Queen. Their daughters have since ruled Phaeacia. The phaeacian queens are skilled mages and generals and lead the cult of the Awakening God.
