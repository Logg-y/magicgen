Steropes is the last of the Elder Cyclopes of Mekone. He survived the fall and gave his advice and crafting skills to the Phlegran Tyrants. But with time the madness and malice of the tyrants grew and Steropes was imprisoned along with his kin. For centuries he forged items for his masters and saw his kin suffer and die. When the Cyclopes shackled under Telepylos were released the remnants of his kin had lost much of their former skills. As the only surviving elder smith he has taken it upon himself to teach his arts to the descendants of the Elder Cyclopes. In this age most Cyclope Smiths have served at least a while as his apprentice. Once a slave to the tyrants himself, Steropes has no interest in oppressing the human population. High ranking Cyclope Commanders as well as the Oppressor Archons have become increasingly suspicious of his intentions.
