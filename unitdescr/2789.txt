The Raven of the Underworld is a monstrous raven of an earlier era. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he made the Raven a herald of death and slaughter and gave it powers of farsight and foresight. The raven was tasked with guiding the dead to the underworld and it became wise in the ways of death. But the Raven grew too close to death and the Pantokrator was afraid that it served the Lord of the Underworld rather than himself. The Pantokrator banished the great bird for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Herald of Death and Slaughter can return to the world of men and bring whispers of death to come. The Raven of the Underworld feeds on the dead and regains hit points if enough corpses are present.
