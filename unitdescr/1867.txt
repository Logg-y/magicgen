The Comitatenses are the field soldiers and the elite force of the Empire. They receive rigorous exercise and training to be able to move quickly despite their heavy armament. While the armies of the frontiers are supposed to hold off enemies, the field army is swift and strong and moves quickly from one frontier to the next in order to reinforce the frontiers or to conquer a neighboring land. The Comitatenses carry shields painted with the Imperial Serpent insignia.
