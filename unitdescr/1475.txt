Deep down underneath the Cave City lie the Halls of the Oracles. Here a few surviving Oracles live in opulent splendor. They are at all times served by the Attendants of the Oracles, lowly human priests who scurry hither and yon to answer every whim of the Ancient Ones. Attendants are able to lead the animated statues guarding the kingdom.
