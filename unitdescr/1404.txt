Aboleths are ancient beings sprung from the depths of the ocean. They resemble huge, mud-crawling fish with tentacles and large, dark eyes covering their foreheads. The polypal spawn is the youngest form of an Aboleth. Polypal spawn grow in great numbers from their Polypal Mothers and live a parasitic life for several years. Eventually the spawn are strong and independent enough to live in symbiosis with the Mother and gather food for her. Spawn have very thick, scaly hides and are quite difficult to squash regardless of their small size.
