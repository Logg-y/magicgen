The crab hybrid is a strange cross between an Atlantian and a giant lobster. It is unknown how this being is born, but it is probably mutated into existence by the Lord of R'lyeh. Crab hybrids are semi-intelligent and entrusted with the care of slaves. In battle, they use their pincers and sheer size to overcome enemies. Crab hybrids cannot leave the sea.
