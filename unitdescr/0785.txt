Gygjas are ancient Jotun hags. Over the centuries, they have grown in might and malice. Gygjas are skilled in the dark witchcraft known as Seith and they can foretell the future. Seith is a magic forbidden to men and only used by female Jotuns. This has led to a growing rivalry between the Skrattir and the Gygjas. Since the Gygjas began to lend the Niefel Jarls their guidance and sorcery, they have become influential in Jotun society. To further their goals they taught the Skrattis skin-shifting and tricked them to serve as vessels in their bloody communions. Now the Gygjas rule Niefelheim in all but name. Their comfortable position has made them less inclined to reawaken the Rimtursar and they generally leave this matter to the Skrattir.
