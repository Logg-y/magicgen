Maenads are human females seduced by the wild lure of a Pan's flute. They enter a state of rapturous rage in which they shed all clothing and join the armies of Pangaea to fight with claws and teeth. Maenads are chaotic and difficult to control. They fight well but are almost useless when patrolling.
