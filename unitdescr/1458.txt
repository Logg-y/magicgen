Ogon the Earth-Blooded is an ancient mage-king and founder of the Agarthan kingdom and the Closed Council. He is the First Oracle and the only one who remembers the oaths sworn to the creators of the Seal. Ogon has lived long enough in attunement with the Earth to become almost immortal. Drawing strength from the Earth itself, he has reached an age and power that would impress the greatest of mages should they ever venture down into the dark caverns of Agartha. With the advice of the Oracles, he plans the conquest of the surface world and has given his son the honor to command the Pale Ones in the War under the Sun.
