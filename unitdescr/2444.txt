The Teotl is a giant of divine heritage. He was placed in charge of the dead and the night by a previous Pantokrator. During day he would care for the dead and during night he would stalk the sick and the dying. Prowling the dark, he observed the night skies and saw the stars. Awestruck and envious, he opened his mouth and devoured them all. The Pantokrator was furious and banished him to the Underworld and stripped him of all flesh so that he could not return. Then he remade the night sky and set a Beast of the Night to hunt those who would covet the stars. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator, the Laws of Death were broken and now the Teotl can return to once more eat the stars. The Teotl of the Underworld wears a necklace of human eyeballs that shine with the light of the stars. The necklace gives him the ability to see everything that has passed and everything that will come to pass.
