Raterik is a strange and secretive knight. As a youth, he befriended a black unicorn and the magical steed gave the peasant boy the opportunity to join the Black Order. Several of the older members of the Order complained about the peasant, but so far he has not failed in his tasks. Raterik has proven himself a resourceful and able commander.
