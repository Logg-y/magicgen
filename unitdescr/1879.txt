Serpent Assassins are initiates of the Serpent Cult trained to rid the Empire of enemies of the faith. Assassins have long been used in both Pythium and the kingdom of C'tis. The main use of the Serpent Assassins is to find and kill subversive cultists in the Empire, but sometimes they are also sent forth to kill foreign priests and important commanders. The Serpent Assassins are given magically enchanted daggers that poison those wounded by their deadly sting.
