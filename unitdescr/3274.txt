During the Malediction, evil was let loose in the kingdom. The Hunger that the evil aroused resulted in cannibalism and practices even worse. Some of the warring nobles succumbed and became vampires who thirsted for human blood. Ludolf von Achenbach was the first of these cursed nobles. Feasting upon his servants to find the savor of old and young, man and woman, he developed a taste for the blood of men who toil the land. Now his lands are slowly becoming abandoned as farmers disappear into Ludolf's demesne. Most vampire counts can dominate human peasants, who become nearly mindless and serve their master as obediently as dogs.
