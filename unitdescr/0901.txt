Dryads are female satyrs. Once all dryads had white fur on their hindquarters and were blessed with aphrodisiac beauty. They were priestesses of the Sacred Groves and were revered by all the wild beings of Pangaea. But now the awakening of the Vengeful Woods has altered the very essence of Pangaea's inhabitants. Dryads with black hides are born, mirroring the dark mood of the forests. These Black Dryads serve the Dark God of the Woods as the White Dryads served Mother Nature in ancient times. They have completely lost the beauty-inspired aura of awe of the white dryads.
