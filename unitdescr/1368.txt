The Seraphim are high servants and heavenly attendants of the Celestial Sphere. They serve the emerging God as he chose to claim this world as his and proclaim His glory. They are surrounded by a divine splendor that must be shielded lest it strike the world with unbearable might. The Seraph has three pairs of wings. The first pair covers the face of the being, the second pair covers its naked feet and the third pair brings the angelic apparition into the air. Anyone striking the Seraph will in turn be struck by awe, fire and blindness. The Seraphim have vast magical and priestly powers.
