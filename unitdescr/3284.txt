Magic in Magnificent Ind is mostly an affair for the monasteries of the land. Here sages of ancient heritage practice the magic of the spheres, the stars and the constellations, taught by Kokabel, the Lord of Civilization. The Sages of Ind were the ones who constructed the Great Mirror and there is always a Sage standing before it prying into its ever-shifting surface. In Magnificent Ind every sage is also an abbot. Even in subservient lands, monasteries are founded where Abbot Sages practice their art.
