Much like the nobles have their palace guards to defend their castles, the Inquisition has their Hands of Justice to defend the purity of the kingdom. Skilled, brave and unquestioningly loyal the Hands of Justice follow their masters whims and orders, be it warfare, guard duty or executions. The arrival of the Hands of Justice in a remote village is often a sign of the displeasure of the Inquisition, and people soon come to the Hands to reveal who has been acting suspiciously since last full moon.
