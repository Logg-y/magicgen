The Dust Priest is an ancient mage-priest buried together with his king in a desert tomb. The priest serves the king in death as he did in life. Upon emerging from the sandy prison, the priest has begun to repopulate the kingdom with the longdead for the glory of his king. Dust Priests have bony, leathery bodies that withstand damage well. They are constantly surrounded by a dry, parching wind. Dust Priests are resistant to fire, but not to cold as most other undead are. They fight with ancient weapons and wear linen armor.
