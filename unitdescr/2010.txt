The Edomites are descendants of the Avvim. They are small of stature compared to the Rephaim, but tall by human standards. They are held in low esteem and considered degenerates at best. Being descendants of the Avvim, Edomites don't have the horns of the Rephaim and are considered weak, ugly and bereft of inner strength.
