During the recent advent of man into their icy lands, the giants of Jotun have discovered the humans to be resourceful allies. With the coming of the New God, the last grudges have been cast aside and men and giants fight side by side. Utg√•rd is ruled by giants, but humans compose most of the population and are frequently used in warfare. The Herse is a human chieftain. They are not allowed to perform religious services and rarely lead giants into battle.
