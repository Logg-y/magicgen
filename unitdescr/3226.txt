The Laestrygonians were once proud generals and warriors of Mekone. They waged war against the gods of men, but failed and were punished for their hubris by a celestial decree. The Gigantes were transformed into Laestrygonian monstrosities with serpents for legs and viper tresses for hair. They are cursed with a foul temper and an insatiable hunger for the flesh of men. The mightiest of them all were imprisoned underneath mountains to prevent them from destroying the world. But their might and fury would not be contained, and the mountains started to spew fire and molten rock. From the Burning Fields of Phlegra, Laestrygonians have emerged from time to time to wreak havoc upon mankind. Woe to the world, should the Tyrant monstrosities imprisoned beneath the burning mountains break free.
