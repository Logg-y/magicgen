The Warlocks of Smouldercone are Blood mages of great renown. They experiment with the summoning and binding of otherworldly beings and the creation of new species. Their most successful experimental achievements to date are the Demonbreds. The Warlocks are the true masters of Abysia, but rarely dabble in politics. Warlocks are Abysians and radiate the hellish heat characteristic of their race.
