There are three clans of Caelians. The Caelians of Spire Horn Mountain trace their lineage from the Kavi heroes of old. The Kavi were blessed by the Mainyus of the sky and their descendants are more closely attuned to the wind and the storms than other Caelians. They have partial resistance to cold and lightning. Many of the Spire Horn Caelians are known for their skill in marksmanship. Archery is much preferred over melee combat and most of the Caelian army is comprised of quick and efficient archers.
