The Phlegran Gigantes are the descendants of the Gigantes of Mekone, who once declared war upon the gods of men. Punished for their hubris the Gigantes were cursed by a celestial decree. They have grown larger than both the giants of Jotunheim and Ashdod, but they have lost much of the discipline and skills of earlier times and their bodies show signs of the curse. The curse has also made them violent and easy to anger. Gigantes are frightening to behold with long hair and serpentine scales covering their legs, and their bodies have become resistant to heat and poison. While their Tyrants still wear armaments crafted by the Elder Cyclopes, most Gigante Warriors wear simple armor of leather and metal scales. Gigante Warriors are arrogant and proud and never take command from human-sized generals.
