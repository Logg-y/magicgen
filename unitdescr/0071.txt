The infantry units of Ulm are clad in chainmail armor made from the Blacksteel of Ulm and armed with heavy weapons and tower shields. They are the strongest standard human infantry units available and are trained to move and fight in heavy armor without tiring. The inhabitants of Ulm are large and can endure much physical punishment before collapsing, but are vulnerable to magic.
