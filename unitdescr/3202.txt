The Hydrophoroi, water-carriers, are libation priestesses of the great temple of the capital. There are only two such priestesses and they are chosen at a young age and serve until they marry. The Hydrophoroi carry the vessels of sacred water used in the celebration of the Hydrophoria. Their priestly influence is limited and they do not lead armies.
