With the emergence of the Cult of the Solar Bull the soldiers of the Limes found a source of comfort otherwise unavailable to them. With the Serpent Cult and its temples and uncaring priests far away, the Cult of the Solar Bull attracted young soldiers with its glorification of battle and promises of a better afterlife. Even the elites of the frontiers, with their relatively comfortable lives, have turned to the Cult of the Solar Bull. They are blessed by their Lord with partial fire resistance and battle prowess. In honor of their Lord, they paint flaring suns on their shields.
