The Magnificent kingdom of Ind has armies of brave and righteous men, but it is not they who wage the wars of the kingdom. Instead it is the heathen tribes subjugated by the Prester King who in times of war are unleashed upon the world. When any of these people die, their friends and relations eat him ravenously, for they regard it as a higher duty to munch human flesh. There are many cannibal tribes serving the Prester King. The Fommepori of the forests are known for their berserker rage and two-weapon fighting style. The Fommepori, like all cannibal tribes under Ind's rule, are frighteningly efficient plunderers.
