Phlegra is ruled by Tyrants of mekonean descent. Punished for their hubris the Gigantes were cursed by a celestial decree. The Phlegran Gigantes have grown and their bodies show signs of the curse. Gigantes are frightening to behold with long hair and serpentine scales covering their legs, and their bodies have become resistant to heat and poison. The Phlegran Tyrants may have lost much of the discipline of earlier times, but they have gained tremendous physical and magical might. They are however, not very bright, and are inept at magical research. The Tyrants are the only Gigantes still wearing armaments crafted by the Elder Cyclopes. Phlegran Tyrants are not very skilled leaders, but they are exceptionally cruel and are intimidating enough to make most helots fight to the very end. Tyrants can round up locals and force them to take up arms and fight for Phlegra.
