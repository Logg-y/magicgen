Pathos was born a long time ago. His mother was a human priestess seduced by the god she served. The young boy was hidden away in the temple to protect him from jealous titans. When he reached maturity, he left the temple and has since traveled to distant lands. Now he has returned to his land of birth. Pathos' legacy makes him very strong and almost invulnerable.
