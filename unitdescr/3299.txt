Cynocephalians are dog-headed beast-men living in the lands of Ind. The Magnificent kingdom has armies of brave and righteous men, but it is not they who wage the wars of the kingdom. Instead it is savage flesh-eaters and cynocephalians subjugated by the Prester King who in times of war are unleashed upon the world. The Cynocephalians of Ind have received the gifts of technological advancement from their masters and are better equipped than in earlier times. Cynocephalians are as prone to plunder and pillage as the flesh-eating human tribesmen and only under the rule of the governor-priests of Ind are they kept under control.
