Flagellants are fanatically devout worshippers who join armies to rid the world of false prophets and Pretender Gods. Most have sworn a vow of poverty and donated their money to a temple or religious potentate. Flagellants earn their name from the practice of whipping themselves pure from evil. They carry flails, which they use upon enemies and their own bodies. Flagellants are not well-trained or well-equipped but possess unequaled fighting morale. They tend to die quickly when exposed to missile fire.
