The warriors of the Ambibates tribe are well known for their martial skills. The nobles of the Ambibates use chainmail armor of Marverni design. It is a disgrace to a Chieftain not to surpass his tribesmen in valor and for a tribesman to leave a battle when the Chieftain has died means everlasting shame. Thus the mere presence of a Chieftain inspires his fellow tribesmen to great deeds. Ambibate chieftains decorate themselves with enchanted wolf tattoos.
