A Helote Soldier that survives long enough to become recognized will eventually be promoted to the ranks of the Iron Bound. The Iron Bound are Phlegran elite soldiers that never retreat from battle. The reason is to be found in the iron bands given them by the Oppressors. These iron bands demand total loyalty from its wearer. If the wearer disobeys or routs from a battle the iron band will cause excruciating pain and possibly death. Thus the Iron Bound almost never rout, even though their morale and loyalty is the same as that of most slave soldiers. The coerced bravery makes the Iron Bound fight more aggressively and they care less about defending themselves. They can only be commanded by mages able to control the collars. If all friendly mages are routed or killed the Iron Bound might end up dying.
