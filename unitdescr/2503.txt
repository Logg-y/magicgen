When the earth was formed the Pantokrator placed a huge pillar at the Roots of the Earth as foundation for the creation and endowed it with vast powers. In time the pillar was discovered by the first pale ones and they began to worship the pillar. Over the millennia they gave it their devotion and their trust and the pillar became sentient and wise. It foresaw the fate of the race that had given it consciousness and it was saddened with grief. When the Pantokrator disappeared the Pillar decided that it would change the fate of the pale ones and make them forge their own destiny.
