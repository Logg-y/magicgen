Blizzard Warriors are sacred archers trained in the Citadel of Frozen Crystal. Once they were elite archers able to fly during storms, but now, by cutting off their wings, they have given up the freedom so highly valued in Caelian society and commit themselves to serving their God and Master. While the Temple Guards defend the sacred lands and temples of High Caelum, the Blizzard Warriors bring winter and snow to the enemies of the faith. They use ice-tipped arrows enchanted with frost magic that can freeze their targets.
