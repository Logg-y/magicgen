All crocodiles are more or less sacred to the populace of C'tis. In the temple marshes some crocodiles are fed slaves and captives. These crocodiles grow to huge proportions. When fed they return into the marshes with their prize and legend has it that they feed their father, a spawn of God, in the depths of the marsh. Blessed by his magic they return to the temples and wait for another sacrifice.
