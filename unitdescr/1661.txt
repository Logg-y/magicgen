Deep in the Smouldercone, the Warlocks of Abysia experiment with their brethren to create superior beings. The Misbreds are defective and malformed Demonbreds. The Misbreds are bound by their nature to serve their masters as slaves. While the Demonbreds are trained as assassins, the Misbreds are given purpose in life by the axe they wield. Misbreds radiate the hellish heat characteristic of Abysians. Misbreds must be led by a mage or commander with undead leadership.
