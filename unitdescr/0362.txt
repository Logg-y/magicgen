Vine ogres are strange, humanoid beings composed of vines, roots and moss. They are twice as tall as any human and will not rout from battle. They live in deep forest thickets and do not venture outside of woods unless summoned by strong magic. Vine ogres are practically mindless and serve their master unerringly.
