Ages ago, the Caelian community was torn apart as the wild clan of the Raptors from Ravens' Vale revolted against the rule of the Seraphs. Under the leadership of the Harab Seraphs, they waged a long and fruitless war with Caelum. Finally, they were expelled from their home. Their legends tell of a great ruler who will lead them back to their homeland in triumph.
