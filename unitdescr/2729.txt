The Muuch are descendants of the Atlantians that invaded the Xibalban caverns after the great flood. They resemble toads and have become known as toad men, although they have fish-like traits as well. The Muuch can live for centuries and they don't stop growing. Wo' Muuch are old Muuch grown to huge proportions. They remember the invasion of the cavernous realm and they are revered by their lesser kin. A few of them have become priest kings, but most of them serve as sacred elite warriors. They are given armaments of obsidian sculpted and enchanted by the Bacabob.
