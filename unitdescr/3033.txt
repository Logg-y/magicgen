The mermen mystics of Old Pelagia were influenced by Berytian and Arcoscephalian lore, though envy and suspicion on the part of the ruling Tritons meant that many restrictions were placed on them. But the Daduchoi, the torch-bearers, hid from the Triton rulers in the Closed Realm. In the Red Land, the colony Erytheia, they found solace and were able to continue their practices. They followed the Red River to its source and discovered the mystery of the Setting Sun. When Old Pelagia was shattered by civil war and Erytheia broke free, the Daduchoi emerged to guide and aid the first King of Both Worlds. With access to the mystery of the Setting Sun the Daduchoi became influential. Now they are responsible for the arcane training of the royal children.
