The Rams-Headed Serpent is a great serpent born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. As a being with great regenerative powers and a bringer of fertility it was worshiped by the first of men as a god of prosperity and healing. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his power and the Rams-Headed Serpent was forever imprisoned in the forest of the Horned One where he found an ally with a temperament resembling his own. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Rams-Headed Serpent is breaking free to claim the world as his.
