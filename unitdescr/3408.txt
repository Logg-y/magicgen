The first Vaetti Hags were given some rudimentary insights into the secrets of Seith by the Gygjas of the Iron Wood, but they were never allowed to advance far in the dark art. Now, with the treason of the Jotun Jarls, the Jotun Gygjas have encouraged the Vaettir to return to the Iron Wood to study the art of Seith under the tutelage of the Jotun Gygjas themselves. Vaetti Gygjas are skilled in Seith, but they are still far from the mastery displayed by their Jotun forebearers.
