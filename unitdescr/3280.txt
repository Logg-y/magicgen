In front of the Sublime Palace and the Onyx Court there is a stairway of sardonyx and porphyry. At the top of the stairs there is a Great Mirror of seven precious stones. From the mirror the sages of the kingdom observe the surrounding lands and alert the marshals if military action is required. The mirror is at all times guarded by soldiers of a priestly order, The Mirror Guard. These are the elites of the soldier priests and they don heavy armor, as they are not expected to leave the capital for prolonged periods of time.
