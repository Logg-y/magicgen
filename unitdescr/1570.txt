Under the influence of the Void, people dream of strange and mind-defying places. The otherworldly Dreams are so clear, yet strange, that the Dreamers are unaware that they are dreaming. Trapped in these strange Dreamlands, the sleeping refuse to wake up. Half asleep and half awake, they try to do what their Dreams tell them. As everything seems unreal to the Dreamers, they are rarely frightened or routed. The supernatural Dreams of R'lyeh protect their hosts and the Dreamers are difficult to affect with magic.
