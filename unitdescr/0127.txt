Blizzard Warriors are elite archers of the Airya clan. They strike from the icy winds with arrows of ice. The Blizzard Warriors are given the best equipment and training the Eagle Kings can provide. They are armed with magical bows and ice-tipped arrows that can freeze their targets and are trained by Spire Horn Seraphs to master flight during storms and bad weather.
