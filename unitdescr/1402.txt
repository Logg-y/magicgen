The Polypal Queen is the first Polypal Mother from which the whole race of the Aboleths has sprung. She has grown for ages in size and power and she has spawned all Aboleth Mind Lords known to live. She is the Aboleth race, its reason and its fate. The Queen is immobile and does not communicate in any comprehensible way, but a constant mental wail surrounds her. The Polypal Queen produces several polypal spawn each month.
