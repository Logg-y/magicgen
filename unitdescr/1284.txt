The Spire Horn clan is less concerned with magic than the other clans. Their Seraphs are less powerful than their Airya kin and they don't use magic other than Air. They command much less respect from their tribesmen. The Spire Horn Caelians were blessed by the Mainyus of the sky in ancient times and can fly during storms.
