The Guardians are entrusted with the security of the mighty Keep of Ulm. Since the emergence of the Black Priests and the construction of the Black Temple, they have received increased status as destroyers of heresy. The priests of the Iron Faith have successfully imbued mundane weapons with divine might. These Blacksteel halberds are given to the Guardians to smite the unholy heretics. Iron, not flesh, is held sacred in the Iron Faith. The swing of a Black Halberd strikes enemies of the faith with exhaustion as divine powers collide.
