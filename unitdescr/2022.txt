There are several races of giants in the land of Hinnom. The Avvim were the first ones approached by the Grigori. The Avvim were taught the secrets of science by the Angels and their civilization flowered. But the Avvim were a handsome and beautiful people and it was not long before the Grigori became interested in the daughters of the Avvim and took them as wives. Their offspring were the Nephilim, giants of godlike power. The Avvim found themselves replaced by the Nephilim and their Rephaim descendants. While they still comprise much of the population, the Avvim only have limited influence in the land.
