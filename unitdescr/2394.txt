When the first of the Sobeks emerged from the temple marsh they were hailed as servants of the awakening God. Their strength and combat prowess was easily recognizable, but they didn't show any interest or aptitude for magic. That was before the arrival of Atun Shar, the Sobek Sauromancer. When the Sauromancers were replaced with Marshmasters, the Sauropeums where Sauromancers were trained and initiated into the mysteries fell into disuse, and Death magic became less frequent in the kingdom. Atun Shar was found meditating in a ruined Sauropeum in the depths of the temple marsh, dressed in a black robe and a royal headdress of unknown origin. When approached by the Marshmasters he claimed to be the promised Sauromancer of the Seventh Book. The fact that there are only six sacred books made the high priests and the Marshmasters concerned, but on the other hand Atun Shar couldn't be charged with sacrilege. He was indisputably powerful and his skills were needed in the sacred war for the Awakening God. Now he serves the Awakening God, but many suspect that he also has his own agenda.
