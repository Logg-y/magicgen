Gandharvas are divine warrior-musicians that left this world ages ago. They serve the Celestial Gods, but are sometimes summoned to this world by the monkey people living on the sacred mountain where the worlds lie closer. Gandharvas are blessed with an Aura of Splendor that strikes mortals with awe.
