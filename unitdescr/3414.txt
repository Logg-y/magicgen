The Dimvaettir are Vaetti assassins known for their use of the horrible dusk daggers. Since they first appeared in the Iron Wood the Vaettir have crafted and used magical daggers forged from darkened steel enchanted with vile magics to become impossibly sharp. In this age the Vaettir have mastered the craft. The Gygjas equip their agents and assassins with the deadly blades and dark robes, and send them into foreign lands to take out enemies of the Awakening God. The magic cloaks of the Dimvaettir gives them the ability to hide in shadows and they are remarkably difficult to find.
