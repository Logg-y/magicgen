The Magnificent kingdom of Ind has armies of brave and righteous men, but it is not they who wage the wars of the kingdom. Instead it is the heathen tribes subjugated by the Prester King who in times of war are unleashed upon the world. There are many cannibal tribes serving the Prester King. The Vintefolei of the steppes are known for their skills in horsemanship, and their most prominent fighters ride into battle with lance and bow. The Vontefolei, like all cannibal tribes under Ind's rule, are frighteningly efficient plunderers.
