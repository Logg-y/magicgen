The Fir Bolg once inhabited the realms now known as Eriu and Man. They were subjugated by the Tuatha and served as farmers and warriors for that race. With the coming of man, their masters withdrew from the world and most of the Fir Bolg were slain. A few of them still remain in the kingdom of Eriu where they serve their Milesian masters as warriors of remarkable skill. Fir Bolg use ancient armaments made from bronze and leather.
