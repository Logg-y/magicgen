Good standing with the spirits of the land is of utmost importance to the barbarians invading T'ien Ch'i. In the time of the Barbarian Kings spirit worship has been reintroduced. Spirit Masters are shamans, sages and diviners of barbarian heritage concerned with the relations between spirits of the wild and men. Spirit Masters wield enchanted spirit clubs that are used to coerce spirits into servitude. The skills needed to battle spirits are not easy to acquire and most Spirit Masters are ancient but skilled warriors.
