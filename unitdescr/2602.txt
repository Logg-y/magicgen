When the Airyas arrived Tur was a stratified society. Families of hereditary priest-mages known as Magi had much influence in the kingdom. The Airya Seraphs adopted the Turan traditions and made themselves Magi of the Airyas. Now there are Magi families of both peoples and the stratification permeates the kingdom. The Athravan, Flame Keeper, is an Airya magus tending the sacred flames of the temples. Since fire is sacred to both peoples of Ragha, they both have Magi tending the sacred fires. The Athravan of Airya follow a tradition where flames must be kept pure from pollution and death. They despise and avoid the Turan Karapans, but recognize their status as priests of the Reawakening God.
