Trolls are robust, humanoid creatures with stone-like skin. While most trolls live in caves in the wilderness, there are some that form small kingdoms under the rule of a mighty troll king. These trolls are skilled craftsmen and make weapons and armor from iron. The war troll is a heavily armed troll warrior of a king's guard.
