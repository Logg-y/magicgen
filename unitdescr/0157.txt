The Mother of Monsters is a hideous being from the dawn of time, when monsters roamed the world. She gave birth to serpent-kin, monsters and giants until the previous Pantokrator rose to power. When he established the new order he banished or slew all that threatened his creation, and the Mother of Monsters and her offspring were imprisoned for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, her shackles are weakening and her offspring once more threaten to destroy the world. As the mother of serpent-kin, she is sacred to lamias and will receive three additional lamias with each summoning. Occasionally she will give birth to strange and misshapen beings.
