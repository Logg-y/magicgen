When the Jade Amazons arrived in Sauromatia, they were largely integrated into the other tribes. There are still a few Sauromatian tribes that have kept their Amazon heritage more or less intact. These Amazons do not use horses by tradition and levy the only shock infantry in Sauromatia. Their martial skills are in every way as good as those of the mounted Sauromatians. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The most common motif is the horse, but the Androphags are known to prefer serpent motifs.
