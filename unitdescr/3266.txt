In the enchanted forests of Mount Shinuyama live animals gifted with supernatural longevity and magic abilities. When an animal gets older and wiser it becomes increasingly more powerful. The Tanuki is a raccoon dog several centuries old. Gifted with shapeshifting abilities and magical powers it loves to cause mischief and even harm to travelers and unwary peasants. Many Tanuki are fond of strong drinks and often present a rowdy behavior. A favorite guise of many Tanuki is that of an impious monk leading people astray. The Tanuki is attuned to magic and its powers are greater where magic is strong.
