Peltasts are light Therodian infantry armed with javelins and spears, recruited in new-founded Therodian colonies. In the rich lands of ancient Therodos most soldiers were given iron armor, but a few peltasts and archers would often accompany the hoplites. Today, due to the scarcity of resources, the use of peltasts is more common.
