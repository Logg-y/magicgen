The Zotz are often called the bat people. They resemble small humans with the head and wings of a bat. It is said that the Zotz once came from Xibalba, a great cavernous realm underneath the forests of Mictlan. The Zotz live in caverns and are rarely seen on the surface world. The Zotz are sensitive to cold and go into torpor if exposed to cold climates. Their legends tell of a time when they were the guardians of the Sun and the Moon during their daily passage through Xibalba.
