The Karib is a human priest. The priests of Na'Ba are divided into two sects; those who regard the Godhood as ascending from the earth, and those who regard the Godhood as descending from the stars. Most of the human population of Na'Ba worship the earthen aspect of the Reawakening God, and while more numerous than the 'Adite Mukarribs, the Karibs have less influence. The human Karibs of the earthen sect can be found throughout the lands of Na'Ba, following the caravans to foreign lands.
