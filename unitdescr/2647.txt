The Kuraka is a warlord of the Nazcan humans. When the Sun King conquered a number of petty kingdoms the prominent humans were allowed to retain some of their influence. With a promise of possible higher status they have a strong will to prove themselves to their masters and are rather cheap to recruit. Human nobles do not receive the full ritual mummification of the Nazcan nobles.
