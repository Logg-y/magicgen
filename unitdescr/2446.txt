The Neter is a giant of divine heritage. A previous Pantokrator once gave him rulership over the world, and the things that brings life; the sun in the heaven and the rivers and waters of the world. He was imprisoned for eternity when he joined a rebellion of lesser gods. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Neter is once more free to claim the world as his.
