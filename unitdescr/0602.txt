The Titan is a giant sprung from thunder clouds. Once given authority and power over thunder and the heavens by a previous Pantokrator, he was tasked with meting out justice to mankind. As Lord of the Heavens he could see everything underneath and would punish sinners with thunder and storms. When he gazed upon the world below, he became aware of the beauty of women and could not help himself. He broke his master's decree, entered the world of men and begot offspring infused with his divine seed. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the rebellious titan for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, lightning and thunder is wrecking the foundations of the prison and the Titan will soon claim the world as his to rule.
