Enkidus are large, hairy wild men with horns and unkempt hair. They live and frolic with the beasts of the wilderness and have only a vague notion of the concept of civilization. There are three Enkidu tribes. The warriors of the pastoral Enkidus have not adopted the metalcrafting of the Avvim and fight with clubs, bows and stone spears.
