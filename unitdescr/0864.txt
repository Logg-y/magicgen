Ekishnugal was the First King and founder of the ancient kingdom of C'tis. His memory still lives in the legends of the kingdom. He was mummified in a great tomb ages ago and has rested peacefully ever since. In recent times, Sauromancers have tried to locate his hidden tomb in order to reawaken the legendary king. When the tomb was found, the traps inside killed many intruders, but finally the Ritual of Rebirth was completed and the First King emerged in unholy splendor. Ekishnugal is a powerful mage of Death and a mighty priest of the dead. He wears a mask of jade to give him a semblance of life. His legendary status inspires C'tissians to great deeds.
