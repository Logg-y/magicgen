The Ghul is a monstrous being related to the Jinnun of Ubar. They served the Afarit before the City of Brass was sealed, but now most of them haunt graveyards and remote deserts where they waylay travelers and feed upon the flesh of men. If presented with human flesh they can be bound to servitude by Sahirs skilled in blood magic. Ghuls are spiritual beings with the heads of hyenas and the hooves of asses. They are able to change their shape and take physical form, although they can never change their hooves. Ghuls are almost unkillable, and only if you strike it down in one blow will it die permanently. If it is not killed outright it will revert to its spiritual hyena-headed form. Ghuls are demonic in nature and can be banished by servants of the Divine.
