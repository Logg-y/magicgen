The Polypal Mothers are the mothers of the whole race of the Aboleths. From their branches grow young polypal spawns that will grow into Aboleths over the centuries. The Mothers are immobile and do not communicate in any way. A constant mental wail that seems to have some effects on their spawns surrounds them, but even the oldest of the Aboleth Mind Lords do not fully comprehend the will of the Mothers. The Polypal Mother spawns a handful of polypal spawn each month. With the growing power of the Reawakened God, the numbers of monthly spawn are increasing. If a Polypal Mother is slain, she will let out a death wail that stuns everyone nearby. The Grandmothers are ancient Polypal Mothers. They seem to have a strange understanding of the arcane arts.
