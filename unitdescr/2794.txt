Demonic Locusts are harbingers of Armageddon and heralds of the Demon Lords. From smoking cracks in the ground they crawl forth to lead the faithful astray and bring turmoil and strife. They appear as giant locusts with crowned human heads and scales of brass and iron. Their shrill angelic voices can be heard for miles and their words are those of false prophets and rebellious demagogues. A swarm of Demonic Locusts will quickly decrease dominion in a province unless dealt with.
