The Arch Seraph is a Caelian mage of such great power that he has taken the role of a Pretender God. Once Caelum was ruled by semi-divine beings known as Yazatas. When they disappeared from the world the Arch Seraph uncovered their magic secrets and became a god in the eyes of the Caelians. The Seraph is able to project his Fravashi, guardian spirit, in times of need.
