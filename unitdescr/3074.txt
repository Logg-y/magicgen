The Kami of Storms is the son of the previous Pantokrator. Together with his brother and sister he was brought into existence when the Pantokrator grieved after banishing his wife to the netherworld. When he blew his nose a divine breath was set free and hastened to the heavens. Watching the breath he hesitated to call it son. After giving his daughter the mandate of the sun and his first son the mandate of the moon, the Pantokrator no longer felt obliged to grant a celestial mandate to his snot-born child. Instead he gave it the mandate of the storms and the sea. Infuriated the third child of the Pantokrator rebelled and caused destruction and disorder wherever he went. With rising ire the Pantokrator watched the misdeeds of his unwanted son and finally imprisoned him for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Kami of Storms is breaking free to once more wreak havoc upon the world.
