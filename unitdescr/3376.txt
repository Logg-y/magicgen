The Marids are rebellious Jinnun of tremendous power. Banished from the City of Brass by the Ifrit Sultans they fled into the depths of the ocean. Now that magic has begun to dwindle, Ubar can no longer keep these rebellious Marids at bay. Absolved from their former sins, the Marids are summoned from their maritime exile to aid the Jinnun against mankind and wreak havoc once more. Marids are powerful Jinnun born from Smokeless Flame, but their maritime exile has granted them powers over water as well as the powers of fire, air and earth.
