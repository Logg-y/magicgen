The Hinn are spiritual beings of an earlier time. They were vanquished by the Jinnun during the reign of an earlier Pantokrator, long before mankind emerged. A few of them still roam the deserts and uninhabitable regions of the world. The Hinn were born from scorching wind and fire and are invisible unless they want to be seen. When visible they take the shape of strange dogs with burning eyes.
