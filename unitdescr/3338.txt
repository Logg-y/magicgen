While most human Nabaeans live pastoral lives, the marvels of the 'Adite cities carved from the desert cliffs have attracted growing numbers of human settlers. Now most 'Adite settlements have a large human population. These humans have adopted 'Adite customs and tactics and readily fight to defend their cities. Now human soldiers march side by side with the 'Adites in the armies of the Awakening God.
