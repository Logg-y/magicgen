The Wardens of Avalon were the sacred guard of the Witches of the Avalonian Age. With the Curse and the disappearance of the Witches, the Wardens were in disarray, but reformed as keepers of the Forest of Avalon. Now they guard the forest and prevent anyone from entering or leaving it. This is a sacred duty and all Lord Wardens are trained as warrior priests.
