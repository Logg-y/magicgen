Kirke is an ancient sorceress and master of herbal magics and medicine. She claims to be the daughter of a titan banished by the previous Pantokrator and no one is old enough to question her. Kirke is a master of metamorphosis, illusions, necromancy and healing arts. She once taught her skills to the first priestesses of Arcoscephale, but has since left that kingdom. She now resides on the enchanted island Aiaia beyond Sauromatia. Here she was approached by the Androphags. Some suspect that it was she who taught necromancy and poison lore to the first of the Witch Kings.
