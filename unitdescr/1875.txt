Throughout the Empire, mystery cults have spread and flourished with the influx of foreign culture. One of these, the Serpent Cult, has replaced the official state cult of the Theurgs, but many others ply their trade in secret. The Cult of the Great Mother is very popular among women and most of the members in its higher ranks are female. The Epoptes is a high ranking member of the Cult of the Great Mother. The liturgy of the mystery cult is heavily influenced by the Arcoscephalean priestesses and their skill in healing. Like all mystics of the Empire, the Epoptes leads worshippers astray and lowers the Dominion in which she resides. She wears a garland and a green dress and carries an urn and a twig as signs of her office. The urn is enchanted and is always full of grain. The Epoptes and Mystes are secretive and do not share their wisdom with outsiders. This makes them rather poor researchers.
