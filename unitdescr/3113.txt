The kryptes are young Gigantes not yet fully trained as hoplites. Part of their training involves murder and combat techniques not used in regular battles. During the krypteion, the annual war on the helotes, every Gigante is free to kill helotes without fear of repercussions. Most of the murders are performed by the kryptoi, who are encouraged to sneak around the countryside and murder helotes with only a dagger. Most kryptoi continue their training and end up as hoplites, but a few are recognized for their exceptional skills and are used as assassins and secret police. A Kryptes fight with only his stealth and a dagger.
