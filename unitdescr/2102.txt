In the courts of the Dragon Kings strange half-men dwell. Crab generals have served the Dragon Kings since they claimed dominion over the seas. They once waged war against the Tritons of Pelagia, but now face the tainted dreams of R'lyeh. Crabs have simple minds and simple dreams and do not suffer much from the call to deeper slumber. Crab Generals are very strong and are covered in thick carapace, making them almost impervious to damage.
