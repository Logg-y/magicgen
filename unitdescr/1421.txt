When the Atlantians fled into the deep swamps and jungles of Mictlan, they found a people that worshipped the Rain as one aspect of their God. They found the secrets of the old blood cult and reinstated these foul practices of the ancient times. Rain is important in the Mictlan Cult. Unless sated with human sacrifices, the God will withhold the life-giving Rain from the Land. The Rain Priest wields priestly power and is skilled in Water and Blood magic.
