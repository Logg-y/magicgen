Crueler beings than humans enjoy a good laugh. Demon jesters, or Harlequins, are lowly devils forced to entertain the infernal lords. Entertainment includes chopping off limbs, the occasional poke in the eye as well as protracted torture. Thus many Harlequins are seriously crippled and most are quite happy to leave the Inferno. They appear as distorted hunchbacks with flapping wings. Their heads are huge and have protruding noses and chins. Demon jesters are more appalling than frightening to behold. They are summoned by the diabolists of Marignon to entertain soldiers and show them that devils are not frightening. Demon Jesters reduce the morale loss caused by mixing demonic forces with humans.
