The Chiranjivi, immortal, was a Bandaraja high king that was entrusted with guarding the sacred scriptures of the Pantokrator. When the Pantokrator disappeared he became curious about how the texts would taste. They tasted excellent. When the last of the sacred texts was consumed the Bandaraja Diraja experienced true enlightenment and became one of the Chiranjivi, the immortals. Now all that is left is to acquire godhood. But other pretender gods have emerged, and they want the sacred lore of enlightenment hidden in the bandar body of the Chiranjivi. The Chiranjivi has acquired a taste for books of lore and will occasionally demand that the works of researching mages be brought to him for consumption.
