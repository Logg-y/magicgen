The Sapa Inca, The Only Inca, is the last surviving Eagle King and co-founder of the Nazcan kingdom. In order to practice higher magic he withdrew from Nazcan society and abandoned temporal power to his Inca sons. Now he has mastered his own mortality and has emerged from sequestration to claim the world for the kingdom he created.
