The Ephor are rulers elected by the Gigante population of the conquered cities. Their main function is political and they only follow armies to restrain the whims of troublesome Polemarchs, as the veto of the Ephoroi can overrule the order of a Polemarch. The Ephoroi are rightly feared by the population of human slaves, called the helotes. Each autumn the Ephoroi declare war upon the helotes to stifle unrest and take out troublesome helotes. Ephoroi are priests of the god-slayer and refute false gods. Through persuasion or coercion they have become good at convincing humanity of their follies. The Ephoroi, like the Gerontes, are skilled leaders, but tradition dictates that they lead a limited number of troops.
