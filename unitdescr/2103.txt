In the courts of the Dragon Kings strange half-men dwell. The Shark warriors are the mightiest of these servants and they form the elite guard of the Dragon Courts. They have the body of a man with a sharklike head. Their skin is thick and tough like that of a shark. The Shark warriors are normally armed with a yari and wear heavy armor. Shark warriors have no problem leaving the sea, but they have not adopted dry land tactics and do not use bows.
