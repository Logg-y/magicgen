The Laestrygonian Gigantes are the deformed descendants of the Gigantes of Mekone, who once declared war upon the gods of men. Punished for their hubris the Gigantes were cursed by a celestial decree. Now they are huge monstrosities of foul temper and an insatiable hunger for the flesh of men. Laestrygonians have serpents for legs and viper tresses for hair. They are able to enter the sea and would probably destroy the world were they more numerous. Laestrygonians do not use armor or weapons, but are fond of throwing boulders on buildings and those who scurry around underneath the roofs. The human population live in terror of the Laestrygonians and try to avoid them at all costs.
