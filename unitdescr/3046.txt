The King of Both Worlds is the monarch of Erytheia, the Kingdom of the Setting Sun. Together with his queen he rules over land and over sea. He is king and high priest, general and master magician. He rules every aspect of his kingdom and soon the world. Since the founding of Erytheia mermen have ruled the Kingdom of the Setting Sun. With the death of his first wife, daughter of an Arcoscephalian Strategos, the first Erytheian king married his own sister, barring dynastic claims from human relatives. Since then every king and queen have married their siblings to preserve the royal blood. The kings and queens share power and are raised knowing that they are divine and gifted with magic powers. All royal children are trained in the magic arts until they marry or die from old age. Some kings and queens have shown signs of insanity and physical deformities. Most mystics claim that this is the workings of a malign force awakening in the deep and propose a conquest of the shattered lands of Old Pelagia.
There is fierce competition among the royal siblings and most kings occasionally execute their brothers on claims of conspiracy.
