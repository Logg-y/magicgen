Nazcan society is divided in two moieties, the Hanan and the Hurin. The Hurin are descendants of the dark winged Caelians. When contact with Caelum was lost the Harab Seraphs advanced their positions and their Hurin descendants have all but replaced the Seraphines of old. Without access to the lore and magic of Caelum, steps had to be taken to preserve the magic of the Eagle Kings and Seraphs. To preserve the knowledge and wisdom of the dead the Harab Seraphs mummified dead kings, mages and priests. As interpreters of the dead they evolved into a caste of priests of the dead, gradually replacing the few remaining Seraphines. Now the Hurin Priests administer most of the day to day affairs of the kingdom. They travel around the kingdom with mummy bundles and interpret the will of the dead, judging the living with the superior wisdom of the dead.
