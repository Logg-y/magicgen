The Head Hunters are the ruling elites of the bone tribes. They lead the bone tribes in attacks on the animal spirit tribes as well as civilized men. They feast on the flesh of men and are feared and despised by all. Their bone charms are made from the bones of wise men and mighty enemies, and are stronger than the charms worn by their lesser kin. The Head Hunters are sacred to the bone tribesmen.
