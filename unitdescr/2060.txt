Since the destruction of Kiriath Sepher, the City of Books, the sages and scholars of the city have scattered over the Rephaite lands. The raging flames utterly destroyed the scrolls and books gathered in the city, but the legacy of the Nephilim kept most of the inhabitants alive. While the Talmai Anakim fled to the Twin Cities, the lesser Rephaite sages ended up in remote settlements and backward villages where they try to write down what they still remember on tablets of clay, impervious to flames.
