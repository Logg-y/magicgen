During the Malediction, evil was let loose in the kingdom. The Hunger that the evil aroused resulted in cannibalism and practices even worse. Some of the warring nobles succumbed and became vampires who thirsted for human blood. Orlak is one of these nobles cursed with undeath. When the Malediction struck Orlak was old and dying. His body revolted against death and he was cursed with a horrific appearance and life eternal. Vampire counts can dominate human peasants, who become nearly mindless and serve their master as obediently as dogs.
