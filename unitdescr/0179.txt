A Master Lich is the dried husk of an Arch Mage adept in Death magic. Through dark rituals, the mage succeeded in mastering one of mankind's oldest and most urgent goals: to defeat death. By removing his viscera and hiding it outside his body, the Lich is virtually impossible to slay. Should the body be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of dead humans. Being immortal, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood. The Master Lich is magically stronger than the other Liches and his magically empowered body is very hard to destroy.
