Buer is one of the Demon Lords. He is the Sun of the Inferno and tortures sinners and demons with searing heat. When summoned into this world, his powers are diminished and he takes a strange and fearsome bodily form. Buer appears as a burning, lion-maned goat's head encircled by five goat legs. The mere presence of the Goat Sun causes the temperature to rise to unbearable levels and in battle soldiers will suffer from severe exhaustion and may faint from the heat. Buer is a Lesser Sun and bound by divine laws to stay on the ground when visiting this world, a fact which he greatly resents.
