The Hashmalim are manifestations of the divine powers of the Celestial Sphere. They appear as brilliant clouds of flashing fire, at the center of which is a body of brass with the likeness of a living being with four faces. They rarely manifest themselves, but their will can be felt as they proclaim the Glory of the Reawakening God. The Hashmalim are particularly good at strengthening the faith of the unsure.
