Devasura is a fallen Devata. He was banished from the Celestial Sphere and stripped of his divine essence. Left without mystical abilities, he has wandered the world in search of ways to regain his powers. Blocked from the Astral Sphere, he has been led to the study of Blood magic. With the Awakening of the God, he has returned to Kailasa in the hope of redemption.
