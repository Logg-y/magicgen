The land of Great Feminie is a kingdom in the land of Magnificent Ind. It was once formed by the proud Amazons of Sauromatia. Women still hold power in the land and everyone of importance is female, not least their mages. The sorceresses of the Great Feminie no longer practice the unsophisticated and bloody arts of the Amazons, but have become influenced by the wise Magi of Ind.
