When the first Mictlan colony was founded beneath the sea, former Atlantians immigrated to the safety of the citadel in the deep. Rain Warriors and Rain Priests from the jungles of Mictlan along with Atlantian refugees previously hiding in gorges and deep kelp forests flocked to the call of the colony's founders. Soon a new breed of mage-priests emerged to rival the high priests of the sacred city. Commanding not just the rain and the jungle rivers they are called Priests of All Waters and their status is second only to the Kings of Rain. The rise to power of these dark-skinned foreign priests is a growing matter of concern to the priestly rulers of Mictlan.
