The Colossi have ruled Phaeacia since berytian times. They are dark-skinned men of great stature originally descendant from the Lion Clan royalty of Great Mababwe. Phaeacia was one of the most prosperous colonies of the Phoenix Empire and many colossi moved to the blessed isle. With time the colossi became almost as numerous as the humans. When Berytos fell the colossi of Phaeacia were a thriving part of the broader population, and not just a small and privileged group. Now the colossi and the humans live and fight side by side. Colossi infantry are armed much in the same way as their human counterparts. Light infantry wear linen cuirasses and wield spears and javelins. Heavy infantry don plate cuirasses and wield short swords.
