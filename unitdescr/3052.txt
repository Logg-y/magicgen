Erytheia, the Red Land, got its name from the Red River, colored golden by the setting sun. Here the Pelagian torch-bearers found the splendor of the Closed Realm brilliant and manifest. The mystery of the Red River let them imbue pearls and gold with the splendor of the setting sun. They brought their mystery as a gift to the King of Both Worlds who adorned his most loyal soldiers in brilliant jewelry made of pearls and red gold. The soldiers were equipped with the last remaining weapons from Old Pelagia and were prepared for the advent of the Awakening God. The Soldiers of the Setting Sun wield jewelry and armors that shines with unbearable splendor of the setting sun while under the light of the sun. The aura of splendor is extinguished in darkness and underneath the waves.
