The Barbarian Kings brought the worship of ancestral spirits with them. Spirits of long-dead warriors and chieftains guide the living in war and peace. Brave warriors give up their free will to allow the ancestors to share their bodies. These Ancestor Vessels are the most feared troops raised in the Empire. The possessed ones fight with superhuman ability and their bows fire howling arrows guided by spirits. The Vessel dons ancient armor and a hideous mask blessed by the ancestral spirits.
