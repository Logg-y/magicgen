A siren is a magical being of the changing shores. Like most beings of Oceania it is capable of changing shape. While under water, she appears as a beautiful woman with the tail of a fish. When she leaves the sea, she takes the form of a gull with the head and torso of a woman. Sirens are gifted with an enchanting voice and can lure men into the sea with their songs. While hiding in a coastal province, a siren can attempt to lure commanders to a watery grave. Sirens are mages of Water and Air. While under water, they lose their Air magic skills, but gain skill in Water magic. Sirens are closely attuned to the changing shores and cost less to recruit in lands of turmoil.
