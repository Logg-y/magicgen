The Earth Serpent is a monstrous serpent born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. Its movements caused earthquakes and avalanches and it was worshiped by the first men who prayed that it would sleep and spare their homes. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Earth Serpent was imprisoned for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the tremors of the stirring serpent can once more be felt in the world. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds. The Earth Serpent is slow, as is its metabolism and life cycle. It doesn't regenerate as quickly as other serpents, but given time, all of its wounds will heal.
