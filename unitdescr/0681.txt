Shadows are the spiritual remains of deceased humans lost in the Shade Lands between the Underworld and the land of the living. Tribunes were representatives of the people of Sceleria in olden times. With the opening of the Soul Gates, they have been brought back from the Shade Lands to lead the spectral forces of Lemuria in the conquering of the physical world. Their time in the Shade Lands has robbed them of some of their spiritual strength, but their priestly authority has kept their minds intact. Their touch can paralyze the living.
