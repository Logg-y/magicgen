The Batab, axe-wielder, is a Zotz chieftain. The Batabob lead small contingents of warriors and raiders, but are rarely given large armies to lead. In the forests the alliance between Muuch and Zotz is more equal and it is not uncommon for a Batab of either species to lead both Muuch and Zotz units.
