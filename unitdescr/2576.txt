The Iceclads were the elites of the Airya clan. Since the return of the Raptors there are few Airyas remaining. Those that did not flee try hard to prove their loyalty. With the aid and equipment of the Airya Seraphs they fight for the Harab Seraphs and the new order. They wield ice blades and are protected by a transparent shield of ice known as an ice aegis. The ice armor is difficult to make and time consuming to forge. The protection gained from ice armor depends on the temperature of the province. Their ice blades are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
