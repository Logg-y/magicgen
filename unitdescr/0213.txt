Salamanders are fiery lizards born in the lava pits of Abysia. Their flesh glows and flames lick their bodies. When injured, the salamander can erupt in a blazing ball of heat and flames. This attack exhausts the lizard, but will surely kill unprotected humans. Special trainers armed with iron prods drive the salamanders into battle.
