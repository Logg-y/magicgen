The Bandar are large, black apes who tower over their fellow apes and monkeys. The color of their caste is red, the color of blood and war. The Bandar are the warrior caste and although few in number, command much influence. The Rakshasas allow lesser Bandar kings to rule the monkey people. The axe is a weapon only used by the Rajas. Unlike the sword, it is not a noble weapon in of itself, but with it comes the power to execute, a power of the king.
