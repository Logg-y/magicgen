The Coya, Moon Queen, is the spouse of the Sun King. She is invariably a black winged Raptor, and is considered to be the daughter of the moon itself. The Coya destined since birth to be queen and she is trained in magic by the priest mage descendants of the Raptor clan from the moment she can utter her first sentence. At the age of eight she is brought to the royal tombs to be taught the deeper arcana from her mummified ancestors. While the Inca represents the Sun and the Sky, the Coya represents the Moon, the Earth, Life and Death. Earth gives birth to life, and to Earth the dead return. The Queen is the most powerful mage in the kingdom, and rules together with her king. When a Coya dies, her spouse sacrifices himself to be mummified together with her in a mummy bundle. The mummy is then brought to the Tombs of the Sun and given proper dues and a stipend to last for eternity. If the Coya doesn't yet have a spouse a young priest will sacrifice himself instead.
