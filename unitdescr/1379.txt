The old Pantokrator was a careful God and he had a single bridge to his citadel of power. This bridge was guarded by the Keeper. The Keeper never sleeps and he sees everything, even in the middle of the night. The Keeper of the Bridge also has skill in Air and Earth magic to complement his already formidable fighting skills. Now that the Pantokrator is dead, the Keeper has seen his chance to become the new God.
