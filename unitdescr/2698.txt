The Apu Illapa, Lord Lightning, is a giant of divine heritage. When his father sinned against the previous Pantokrator the Apu Illapa inherited the rage of the storms in his father's stead. He was given dominion over the Sky and the Winds and everything in the air. During the rebellion against the Pantokrator he allowed the Sun to remain in the sky and for this he was punished with eternal imprisonment. Now with the Pantokrator gone his shackles are weakening and vast thunder clouds are gathering. Soon he will be free to claim all beneath the sky once more.
