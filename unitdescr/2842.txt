The humans of Therodos were struck hardest by the cataclysm. Those who survived the initial blast drowned when the land sunk underneath the waves. Once dead their shattered souls were barred from entering the underworld and their ghosts remained in the sunken lands they once inhabited, unaware of their undead state of existence. The Therodian ghosts live in death as they did in life, following their Daktyloi and Kourete masters toiling the land and fighting their wars. Spectral hoplites fill the ghostly ranks of the Therodian armies, ready to reclaim the lands of ancient Therodos.
