The Deives of the Sun is a giant of divine heritage, once given the splendor of the Sun by a previous Pantokrator. Every morning she rose and brought warmth, comfort and fertility to frozen lands. So great were her powers and so great her mercy that mankind turned away from the Pantokrator and gave her their prayers instead. Furious he stripped her of authority and imprisoned her for eternity. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, her prison is crumbling and the Deives can reclaim her lost authority and bring the warmth and comfort of the Sun to mankind once more.
