Starspawns are ancient Illithids of tremendous power. Most remember the day when the Star fell and the City of R'lyeh was built. The Starspawns are masters of Astral magic and adept in the path of Water. Some carry priestly authority and all are masters of the mind. All Illithids are amphibious and able to use a mind blast attack in battle.
