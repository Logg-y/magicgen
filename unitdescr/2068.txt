Putrescator was once an Augur Elder of exceptional powers. His true name no longer remembered. He once led the Augurs of Ermor to study the darker aspects of C'tissian magic. Under his guidance the augurs were led to believe that a great cataclysm would change the future of the realm and bring power unimaginable to the empire. With power over death and rebirth, the lords of the empire would become immortal and Ermor would become everlasting. With the downfall of the empire, Putrescator was cursed and the remnants of his soul have returned to destroy the living in the name of the Reawakening God.
