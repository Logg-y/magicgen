The Wadjet, Green One, is a Great Serpent born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It made the sacred river its home and became worshiped as protector of the land and a bringer of annual prosperity. During the rebellion of the lesser gods the great serpent remained neutral and tried to protect its subjects from the madness of warring gods. When the Great Antagonist was defeated the Pantokrator imprisoned every spirit and monster that hadn't fought against the Enemy. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles of the eternal prison is weakening and the Great Serpent is preparing to return to the sacred river and the beings that dwell there. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds, and the Green One is no exception.
