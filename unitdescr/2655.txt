The Apuskispay is the highest ranking officer in the kingdom. He leads the army of the Inca and answers only to him. Being a close relative to the Sun King he will be mummified upon death. When an Apusqispay dies his body will be retrieved and brought back to Nazca where he will be embalmed in a bundle wrapped in cloth and leather, together with jewelry and riches.
