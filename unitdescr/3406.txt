When a Glacier calves a Niefel Giant, smaller shards of ice also break free. These are the Rimvaettir, small beings reminiscent of the Niefel Giants with whom they share their birth. They once only lived in the frozen lands of the Rimtursar, but later they emerged when called by the Jotun Skrattir, the Heralds of Winter. Since the founding of the Vaetti Jarldom the Rimvaettir have once again returned, and gather at the frost-covered Iron Wood to serve the ones promising to bring about Eternal Winter. Rimvaettir are surrounded by an icy wind and wear armaments of tempered ice made by Gygjas skilled in the magic of frost and winter. The Rimvaettir of the Iron Wood are sacred to the Vaettir of Vaettiheim.
