In the deepest reaches of Agartha lies an ancient chamber sealed by ancient magic. According to Agarthan lore, the Chamber contains three imprisoned gods of an earlier age. Umbrals and Penumbrals lurk in the deep cavern halls close to the prison. Penumbrals are shadow beings resembling Pale Ones with elongated faces and drooling mouths. They are smaller and less frightening than the true Umbrals. Agarthan legends claim that they are the souls of those who sacrificed themselves to Seal the Chamber. The disturbing fact that they have become more numerous has led some to believe that the Seal is weakening. Penumbrals are ethereal, undead beings capable of draining life from the living.
