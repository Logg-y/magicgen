The Bandar are large, black apes who tower over their fellow apes and monkeys. The color of their caste is red, the color of blood and war. The Bandar are the warrior caste and although few in number, command much influence. The king and nobility are always Bandar. Swords are considered the most noble of all weapons and are only given to sacred warriors or generals. To be given a sword is a sure way to advance in society and to make enemies. With the sword comes the duty to protect the Kala-Mukha sorcerers and the Rakshasis.
