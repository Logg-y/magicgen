The Sea Dragon is an ancient reptile of tremendous physical and magical power. Born before the history of time, Sea Dragons have grown in might and magical mastery. They are enormous asp turtles with sinuous necks and tails. Dragons are closely attuned to the magic that brought them into life and thus focus mainly on one magic path. The physical bodies of Dragons are not well suited for spell casting. Sea dragons have their skills reduced when casting spells from paths other than Water. Therefore, Dragons tend to adopt human form, but when wounded, they revert to their greater Dragon form. Sea Dragons can only leave the sea while in human form.
