Vod is a bear, blessed by the Bear of the Stars. He is endowed with wisdom as well as physical might. Having observed the men of Rus he decided to guide them through all the stages of life. Birth, hunt, marriage, war and death. With his arrival the cult of the Bear has gained influence and Vod has become its most prominent Priest, almost rivaling the influence of the Sons of Heaven in their Hall of the Dawn. Vod prefers to wear chud shape, but if he gets wounded in battle he reverts to his natural form.
