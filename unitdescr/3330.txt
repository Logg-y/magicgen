The Betyl is a God Block, a large carved stone block inhabited since time immemorial by a spirit of vast powers. Once worshiped as a God the spirit taught men how to read and write. When mankind became knowledgeable and wise, the spirit attracted the attention of a previous Pantokrator and was bound to the stone block for its hubris. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a Reawakening God, ready to claim the earth.
