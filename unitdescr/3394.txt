Born at the dawn of time the Serpent of the Underworld represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It has the appearence of a huge serpent with the head of a deer and a tail of interwoven chains of gold. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Great Serpent was bound in a twisting cave beneath a great mountain to guard the riches of the underworld. With the Pantokrator gone the Great Serpent from the dawn of time will return to claim the world as his.
