The Ice Devils are the rulers of the icy realms of Inferno. Their large bodies are composed of ice and they are constantly surrounded by a wind of infernal cold. Ice Devils are powerful mages of Water, but it is their physical might that makes them the generals of the infernal wars. There are only six known Ice Devils. Bune is skilled in the dark arts and his armies are composed of the dead, buried and frozen in the ground of his icy realm.
