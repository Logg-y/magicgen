The Seraphines are female priests of the ice temples. With the fall of the Raptors and the failed cleansing of the Purifying Flame they have lost some of their importance. The High Seraphs have become rulers of the kingdom and the old traditions have lost some of their appeal. The Seraphines conduct services, keep the remaining flames alight, and tend the frost flowers of the ice gardens. Each frost flower is said to hold the soul of a dead Caelian and there is rumor of a hidden garden of ashen flowers in Ravens' Vale. Since the fall, the Seraphines have gained a more martial role. They perform the horrible ceremony of wing cutting and lead the Temple Guards into battle. Seraphines sometimes set up secret cults in human lands. Their wings and beauty allow them to present themselves as angels and divine messengers.
