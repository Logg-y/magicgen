The Vaettir have always tamed and used wolves as companions and they are commonly known as the Wolf Kin. Being small the Vaettir have used their wolf companions as mounts since they first appeared in the forests of Jotunheim. The Wolf Brothers are to the Vaettir what knights are to humans, mounted elite warriors with superior armaments. They are as skilled as the Hirdvaettir and are often deployed as an elite force infiltrating and attacking far into enemy lands.
