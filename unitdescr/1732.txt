The longdead are skeletal warriors of ancient times, reanimated to do battle with the living. They emerge from their tombs and crypts with rusty weapons and armor. The longdead are skilled fighters, but their bones are brittle. They do not rout unless their master is killed. The longdead are mindless and will quickly dissolve if they are broken on the battlefield.
