The Ghulah is a female ghul. They share the traits and appetites of male ghuls, but they are also skilled sorcerers and are by far more feared than their male counterparts. Ghulahs use their shapeshifting tricks to come close to and kill unsuspecting men and feast upon their flesh. Although they are skilled shapeshifters they cannot conceal their hooves and so they hide their feet with long white gowns. When they are wounded they revert to their hyena-headed beastly form, dressed in tattered rags.
