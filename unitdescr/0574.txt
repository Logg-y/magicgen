Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land. Both humans and animals have underwater counterparts. Tritons are the most common of the aquatic humanoids. They appear as humans with legs ending in fins. The Amber Clans are secretive orders of Triton aristocrats led by mages and priests who served the Triton Kings. They are proud and strong and a few of the clans managed to survive the Atlantian onslaught. The Amber Clans have since become independent and denounced the rulership of the Triton Kings. The Amber Mages forge strange amber armor for their guards.
