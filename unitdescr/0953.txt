The sacred kings of Machaka have ruled the kingdom for ages. The prosperity of the land is closely connected with the king and in times of hardship, the king is sacrificed to reverse the misfortunes of the land. Yasini is the current King of Machaka. He was fortunate enough to be born at a time when the Lord incarnated and this has granted him a rather long life as king. Yasini is charismatic and possesses a Divine Aura as a sign of his high standing in the eyes of the Lord.
