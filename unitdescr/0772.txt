An ancient god released from its imprisonment in Tartarus, the cyclops has tremendous power, but is likely to be insane after suffering aeons of perpetual pain. The body of the ancient god is dead, but its willpower keeps it alive in a state of constant decay. The cyclopses serve as smiths in Tartarus and make enchanted weapons and thunder bolts for the Lord of the Underworld.
