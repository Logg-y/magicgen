The Sauromatians are ruled by women and women fight side by side with male warriors. The Sauromatians allow only women to wear heavy armor. The heavier the armor and horse barding a warrior owns, the higher her place in society. The cataphract warriors have the highest standing of all and only formidable warriors will become cataphracts. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The number of tattoos represent standing in society and more prominent warriors are covered in dark etchings.
