The Dharmapalas were giants of divine heritage tasked by a previous Pantokrator with upholding the celestial laws. The Dharmapala of the Underworld was given mandate over the laws of death and rebirth. He took the Throne of the Underworld and made himself judge and ruler of the dead. His demonic servants guided the dead to their next life. But with time his mind darkened, and he was seduced by jealousy and hunger for power. He demanded prayers from men in return for a good afterlife. His judgment lost righteousness and his servant demons wrongfully led the newly dead to the hellish realm of the Dharmapala. When the Pantokrator realized that his most trusted servant had broken the laws of death and rebirth to collect the prayers of men he was furious and imprisoned the Dharmapala in this world, disconnected from the Hell he had created. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Dharmapala is free to once more judge the dead as he sees fit.
