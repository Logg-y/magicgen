There is in Ind a land where live women with great bodies, flat heads and beards down to their breasts. These women are excellent huntresses and they raise lions of strange colors instead of dogs, and bring these beasts with them when they hunt. The nobles of Great Orionde often acquire a huntress to patrol their lands and display at their feasts. But this is a dangerous game. If the woman feels ridiculed the feast might turn sour and she will release her lions upon the participants. Such is the way of the Great Huntresses of Ind.
