A clockwork soldier is a spring-driven, automated warrior. The spring of the clockwork soldier is wound up before battle and the soldier is released close to the front of the battle and pointed at the enemy. The clockwork soldier then quickly walks forward driven by its magical springs. If everything goes as expected, the clockwork soldier will use its sword to tear into the enemy ranks and its shield will whirl around in a random fashion to block enemy attacks. Fortunately, the springs and clockworks powering the soldier will only allow for a short burst of frantic attacks before they need to be wound up again.
