The most prominent families of the Chudes claim to be descendants of the gods and the Lord of Heaven himself. Chud men of divine heritage are called Sons of Heaven, Dieva Deli, and command great respect among Chudes and humans alike. From the Hall of Dawn they lead the cult and perform all the important ceremonies to the Awakening God. The Sons of Heaven are blessed with some magic powers, but their role as priests and leaders of the settled communities outweighs their role as mages and sages.
