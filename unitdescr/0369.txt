In the temples of the Onyx tribes, the bones of horses are reassembled by the sorceresses and given to warrior maidens of the temple to ride. The maidens who ride the Nightmares use their own life force to keep the abominations together. This is very exhausting, but well worth the effort. The otherworldly shrieks and gruesome appearance of an undead horse are enough to scare even the bravest of warriors. The Nightmares are sacred troops and can be blessed.
