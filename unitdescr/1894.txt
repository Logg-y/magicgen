The Ministers of Magic are mages of the Bureaucracy. They travel across the land to further the magical knowledge of the nation. They often end up in remote villages studying strange phenomena. Having received arcane training at one of the magical schools of the Bureaucracy, most of them have a standardized and scholarly approach to magic and few of them become powerful mages. They are, however, quite good at magical research. They can be distinguished from the common folk by their Imperial blue robes and their bamboo rod.
