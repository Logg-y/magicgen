The Statue of the Bloody Mother is the spirit of a goddess of birth and blood once slain and bound in a huge stone statue by a previous Pantokrator. With the Pantokrator gone, its will and its thirst for blood are reawakened. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.
