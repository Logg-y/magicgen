Turan society has been stratified since the arrival of the Abysians. A few families of pure blood have made themselves priest-mages and jealously guard their privileges. The priest-mages of these families are known as Magi. The Dastur is a Turan High Magus of the old Daevic cult. They worship the Daevas and have used tainted magic since before the forming of Ragha. They still use Blood and Death magic in conjunction with Fire magic. To the Dastur, the flames must be fed the flesh and blood of the living in order to gain power. The Zaotar and the Dastur share power and influence in the courts of the Shahs. The two priestly orders despise each other and bickering and plotting for power is common in the courts. For a Shah to be inaugurated, a High Magus must be present and the two orders compete for the right to perform the rituals of inaugurating a Shah to office.
