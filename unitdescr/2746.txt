For centuries the Muuch have lived in the dark caverns of Xibalba. In the deeper caverns where light never shines the Muuch have evolved pale skins and large eyes able to see in total darkness. When the greenish Muuch of the upper caverns and the brown surface-dwelling Muuch prepared the conquest of the sun-lit world, the conservative white toads, Sak Muuch, stayed behind and cautioned their kin. The Ajaws did not listen. Now the only remaining Muuch are the white toads of the deeper caverns. The Sak Muuch use armors of bronze that do not rust.
