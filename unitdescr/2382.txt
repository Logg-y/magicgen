Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land. Both humans and animals have underwater counterparts. Tritons are the most common of the aquatic humanoids. They appear as humans with legs ending in fins. Triton tribes, like humans, often follow a totemic spirit. The Turtle Tribe Tritons mimic their totem and don armor made from turtle shells. Most tribal Tritons live separate from the Triton kingdom of Pelagia, but some have joined forces with the Triton Kings.
