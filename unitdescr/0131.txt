After the fall of the Raptor clan the Spire Horn Caelians have become the martial clan of the magocracy. The Caelians of Spire Horn Mountain trace their lineage from the Kavi heroes of old, blessed by the Mainyus of the wind and storms. They have partial resistance to cold and lightning. Many of the Spire Horn Caelians use bows, but the warriors of the clan are remarkably skilled fliers and they are known to swoop down and attack unsuspecting armies during raging storms. Their ice lances are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
