The war lobster is a huge lobster mounted by an Atlantian spearman. The lobster is steered by small coral shards inserted under its shell. When the rider dies, the lobster is capable of free movement and since it can trample smaller beings, it becomes a threat to friends as well as enemies. War lobsters cannot leave water for the extended periods of time needed for battle campaigns.
