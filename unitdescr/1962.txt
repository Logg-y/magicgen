Alexej is the current Patriarch of the reformed faith. He was an Eparch for several years before becoming Patriarch. Only with the unforeseen and inexplicable death of his predecessor was he able to seize power. Several of the other candidates had voiced complaints about Alexej during the election procedures, but many of these rivals disappeared soon after his inauguration. Alexej was not always a priest. He joined the Khlysty at a young age, but left the cult after a brief encounter with Blood magic. After several years as the student of an old and remarkably skilled occultist, he reembarked upon the journey to priestly power. His former dedication to the Khlysty gave him popular leverage and he became one of the first Exarchs with a Khlyst background. Alexej now commands great respect among the population and many Khlysty seek him out to give him their services. Alexej knows better than to ignore their offers of assistance.
