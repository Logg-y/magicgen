The Morrigans are heralds of death, collectors of souls and bringers of strife. They are the fates of the battle ground, weaving looms of entrails with arrows for shuttles. Their chant colors the skies red before battle. In the shapes of crows they pick the eyes of the dead. The Morrigans are horrible beings of death and destruction sometimes summoned by the Fomorians in battle. They appear as grisly warrior women garbed in gory dresses.
