The Paqo is a shaman and priest healer of the Nazcan humans. Female shamans receive their calling from dreams sent by the Earth Mother and they can prevent misfortunes. Considered heretics by the priests of Nazca they are still used for their skills in herb lore and medicine. The Paqo follow their own traditions and rarely share their magical insights with the Nazcan mage-priests.
