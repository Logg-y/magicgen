The Malikum, deified kings of Sheol, surround themselves with dead Rephaite heroes. These are known as the Ditanim, the assembly of Ditan. When a Malik joins a banquet for the dead, he will bring with him his Ditanu heroes. The Zamzummim have learned how to summon the Ditanim and coerce them into serving the living instead of their dead kings. Ditanim are huge, ethereal apparitions armed with weaponry enchanted at the dawn of time. They are formidable warriors endowed with magical powers.
