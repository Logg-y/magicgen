With the return of the Harab Seraphs the Spire Horn Warriors have been all but replaced by Raptorian warriors. During their exile the Raptors have mastered steel-crafting and equip their warriors accordingly. Light and artfully crafted plate cuirasses are used, but heavier armor is avoided as it makes flight very exhausting. Most Raptorians use lances and swoop down upon their enemies. Melee is much preferred to archery among the Raptors.
