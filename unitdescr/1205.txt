The Gutuaters are priests of the wild and the elements. They are reclusive and gather at sacred groves where they perform religious sacrifices of men and beasts. They are also the ones that etch and enchant a young warrior's first tattoo when he becomes a man. Their power to awaken the enchantments of a warrior's tattoos makes them invaluable in battle and they are sometimes forced to join armies regardless of their own wishes. The Gutuaters are able to perform blood sacrifices for their lord, but do not dabble in Blood magic.
