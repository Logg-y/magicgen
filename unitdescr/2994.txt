Chudes are an exalted race of might and beauty far superior to ordinary men. Like their human allies they live divided into two moieties and for the most part have more in common with their human counterparts than the Chudes of the other moiety. The Chudes of the second moiety live in small settlements together with humans and only encounter their nomadic kin at betrothal and marriage, as marital customs demand that no one marries within his or her own moiety. Some settled Chudes still carry the legacy of the Bear and are able to unleash the rage. They fight with two weapons in disregard of their own safety.
