When human tribes first arrived in the land of the Tuatha they were few and came in small groups. Small tribes led by warrior shamans settled among the Fir Bolg and brought iron and steel to the land. They called themselves Logrians and shared traditions, but little else. When the Fir Bolg were defeated, petty kings laid claim to the land. They called their kingdom Logris. There are still many families who trace lineages back to the first Logrians. These men are are of larger stock and stronger than most of the inhabitants of Man. Logrians who are rich enough to own horses, but not of noble blood, arm themselves with light lances and don ring mail armor.
