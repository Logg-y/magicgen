Sigrdriva is one of the first Vanir. She was once the lover of Vanlade, but she became jealous of the power he was granted by an ancient god. She brought her sisters to the god and was equally blessed and cursed. The Valkyries were tasked with guiding the dead, but gifted with powers of flight. Sigrdriva became one of the first Disir, warrior sorceresses of the Valkyries, and her powers were great. With the demise of their god she followed his example and hanged herself to gain knowledge and power. Later the rivalry between Vanlade and Sigrdriva increased. She sent her daughter to steal Odrörer and the Mead of Poetry, but Sölvis was captured. When Sigrdriva and her Valkyries rescued Sölvis from her capturer Siggi, the ungrateful daughter rebelled and swore to serve Vanlade in his war against Helheim. Sigrdriva is called Hangadrottning, as the only one of the Disir to have hanged herself. Her status in Helheim is undisputed and even the Hangadrotts listen to her wise words.
