The Asynja is a female Aesir who has survived the death of her kin. The Aesir were ancient gods who were defeated aeons ago by the Rimtursar in a cataclysmic battle. When the war ended the last remaining Aesir were banished by the Pantokrator. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the Asynja has returned to the world to claim it as hers.
