The Horned One is a giant of divine heritage once put in charge of the wild by a previous Pantokrator. As lord of beasts, berserkers and wild revelry he is also known as the Horny One. When he made an attempt on a mistress of the Pantokrator he was trapped in a magic forest for eternity, with beasts as only company. In the enchanted forest primordial beasts were also bound. The Golden Boar, the Ram-Headed Serpent and the Great White Stag pledged the Horned One their service. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Horned One has found a way out of his woodland prison to once more revel in the world with beasts and men.
