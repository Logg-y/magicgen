The Raksharani is a Raksha queen with powers to rival the eldest of the Siddhas. She has lived for ages and her powers has grown through the centuries. She was one of the first Rakshasis to approach the apes of Kailasa and she quickly rose to become their queen. Now with the Pantokrator gone she has revealed herself in full splendor to claim this world as hers. The Raksharani like all Rakshasis is able to shapechange into an alluring redheaded woman. She is also able to use the power of Maya, illusions, to fool unenlightened ones.
