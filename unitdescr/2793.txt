The Serpent of Chaos is a monstrous serpent born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It was a monster of darkness and destruction which fought and tried to devour the sun. It is the eternal enemy of the Solar Serpent, the guardian of the Sun. During the rebellion of the Lesser Gods it was the herald and general of the Great Antagonist. The Serpent of Darkness was finally defeated by the son of the slain Pantokrator and banished for eternity. Now, with the waning of the old decrees, the Serpent of Chaos and the Solar Serpent are preparing to once more bring the primordial battle of light and dark to creation. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds, and the Serpent of Chaos is no exception.
