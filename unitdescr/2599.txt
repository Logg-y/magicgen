Turan society has been stratified since the arrival of the Abysians. A few families of pure blood have made themselves priest-mages and jealously guard their privileges. The priest-mages of these families are known as Magi. The Karapan is a Turan Magus of the old Daevic cult. They worship the Daevas and have used tainted magic since before the forming of Ragha. They still use Blood and Death magic in conjunction with Fire magic. To the Karapan, the flames must be fed the flesh and blood of the living in order to gain power.
