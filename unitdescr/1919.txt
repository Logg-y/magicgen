Self-mutilation is widely respected among the Khlysty, but few go as far as the Fivefold Angels. The Fivefold Angel is a Khlyst priest that has passed all five seals and mutilated his body utterly, to recreate his body in the image of an angel. The flesh and skin of their backs are torn and spread with wooden spines to resemble wings. Their hands are cut off to inspire faith and they refuse to use weapons. Instead, their faith prevents them from taking harm and anyone attacking them will be hurt himself. The Fivefold Angels travel into foreign lands to set up secret Khlyst cults and inspire faith and disorder. All Fivefold Angels have skills in Blood magic.
