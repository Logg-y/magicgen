The King of Elemental Fire is a physical manifestation of the wild magic of Fire. Once there were three such spirits, but one of the three, Catharsis, was corrupted and used by the Lord of the Underworld to give light to his dark realm. The Cleansing Fires of Catharsis now burn with a sickly green, poisonous light. Catharsis is now known as Anthrax and serves the Master of the Underworld. He has a body of blazing banefire and appears as a huge, crowned king. Anthrax is innately skilled in Fire and Death magic and is constantly surrounded by a shield of blazing banefire.
