The Gigantes of Mekone have enslaved their neighbors and much of their armies are comprised of human slaves, helotes. Coerced into military service these helote soldiers have abysmal morale, and fear rather than loyalty keeps them in line. However, the Gigantes are few and the humans are numerous and expendable, so helotes have been given armaments to serve in wars for a long time. Helote hoplites are the elites of the slave warriors. They are given heavy bronze armors and fight in dense formations like their Gigante masters. Helote hoplites that show exemplary skills and bravery can be elevated to neodamode status.
