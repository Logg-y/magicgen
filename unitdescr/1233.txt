The Lord of the Waves is an underwater being born at the dawn of time, when the sea was untamed and filled with monstrous beings. The Lord of the Waves was given power over all shallow waters and the waves, where the sea meets the winds, by a previous Pantokrator. But hubris found him and he sired the tritons and let them worship him as though he was a god. The Pantokrator was furious and banished his rebellious servant for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Lord of the Waves is once more free to receive the prayers of triton and men alike. The Lord of the Waves is able to leave the sea and can bring land-living beings with him into the sea.
