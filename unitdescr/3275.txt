The Knights of Man are nobles trained to battle from childhood. They are skilled in swordplay, music and horsemanship. In the time of Logris the rival petty kings gathered groups of influential and skilled warriors to their cause. Now the descendants of these first Logrian nobles have become the ruling class of Man. But not all knights are wealthy. With a hereditary system that favor the oldest sons many nobles have found themselves impoverished and without land. In earlier times these landless knights fought for glory and promises of lands to call their own. Now with the imminent awakening of the Lord they fight for a higher cause. Landless knights can rarely afford horses, but they generally have enough money and contacts to wear good armaments.
