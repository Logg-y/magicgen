The Titan of the Spring is a giant of divine heritage born in primordial times. When her Father rose to power he gave her authority over all things growing. But the Great Adversary became enamored with her and abducted her to the Underworld. The Pantokrator had placed a Veil between the worlds to prevent the plots of his Adversary, but his daughter was lost beyond the Veil and the world slowly withered and died. Only with the aid of the Queen of Crossroads who was able to venture beyond the Veil was the whereabouts of the Titan of Spring found. The Pantokrator was the ruler of this world and his powers were diminished in the Underworld. With guile and subtle threats he confronted the Lord of the Underworld and Spring was allowed to return to the world of the living, and all rejoiced. But mankind fell in love with The Spring and began to worship her as a God. Her Father was furious and sent her back to the Underworld. Now with the Pantokrator gone, his daughter can once more cross the Veil and return to this world, worshiped as bringer of growth and benefactor of the dead.
The Titan of the Spring is reborn every Spring. Lamentations of her subjects cannot sway the Lord of the Underworld, but if dead she is allowed to return to the living spring come.
