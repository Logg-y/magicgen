The Panic Apostate is a Pan who has forsaken the old ways in order to avenge the damage done to the wild. By calling dark forces and giving life to that which has died, the Apostate follows a new and dark God in an attempt to destroy those who have harmed Nature. The Apostate is a powerful Nature mage and has learned some necromancy in its quest for vengeance. It has lost its power over the lust and wild emotions of human females and is thus unable to call maenads.
