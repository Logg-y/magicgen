In the Tomb Halls of Old Agartha lie ancient mummified Oracles awaiting rebirth. The Servants of the Oracles are priest-mages who attend the needs of dormant as well as reborn Oracles and divine their will. With the emergence of Agartha the servants have followed the marching armies to spread the glorious message of the Awakening Lord.
