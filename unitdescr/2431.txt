The Titan of the Underworld is a giant of divine heritage. Once given the task of ruling the dead by a previous Pantokrator the Titan was forbidden to enter the land of the living. Forever banished from the living world the Titan watched in envy as the living went about their business. He made his realm a dull and pale replica of the land under the sun. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Titan of the Underworld can return to the land of the living, with his gifts of death and darkness. The Titan was once given a helmet of invisibility by the cyclops smiths of Tartarus. With the aid of this helmet he has occasionally entered the world of the living to observe and slay those who display hubris.
