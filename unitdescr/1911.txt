The Defiler of Dreams is a Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering. This particular kind of Horror is able to fill the dreams of sleeping people with horrible images and feeds on the resulting distress. It is elusive and will stay hidden and mark people and feed on their dreams. All horrors have strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack creatures previously marked by Astral magic. Horrors sometimes appear in highly magical countries to attack people that have been marked by evil Astral mages.
