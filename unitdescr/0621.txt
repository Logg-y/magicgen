The Treelords are ancient living trees that once were vibrant and very powerful. Now they are dormant, getting slower of body and mind with every passing year. These decaying Treelords can be reawakened by the use of Nature magic. A reawakened Treelord will serve its awakener until it dies. Treelords have very long lifespans. They are sacred to vine men and as a result, Treelords can reawaken vine men in greater numbers than other mages. There are three Treelords remaining to be reawakened.
