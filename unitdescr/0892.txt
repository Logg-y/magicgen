Witch doctors are reclusive mages of the wilderness. Some witch doctors live in villages where they heal the sick, while others hide in the wild and afflict trespassers with fever. Witch doctors shun contact with other mages and never reveal any magic secrets willingly. This makes them very poor magical researchers.
