Once, long before the arrival of the Amazons and the Witch Kings, there lived a highly magical race in the Sauromatian steppes. They are called Partholonians by the few who still remember them. With the emergence of the Witch Kings, the few remaining Partholonians were driven from their lands and the Witch Kings stole their knowledge and ate their flesh. Delgnat, daughter of Sera and an able sorceress, stayed and witnessed the passing of her remaining kin. With growing despair, she watched her last kinsman die. In defiance of the old traditions, she turned to dark sorcery and reanimated her brothers and sisters and created a court of the living dead deep in the misty swamps of Sauromatia. Here she was approached by Skögu, who wooed her, slew her and ate her. Her dark practices had prepared her for this and she returned in flesh to haunt the Witch King. Skögu was enamored and took her as his seventh and final wife and together they built a castle for the dead. Delgnat is immortal, but her body slowly withers if she leaves her castle of dead memories.
