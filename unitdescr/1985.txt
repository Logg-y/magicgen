The tribe of Levi are known for their fanaticism and religious fervor. It is the only tribe that is allowed to train priests. Sometimes a particularly pious Levite emerges to claim prophethood and lead other Levites. These Nabi'im are not trained in the temple and regarded with some suspicion by the Gittites. To secure their faith and loyalty, they are given the outfit of a Kohen Gadol.
