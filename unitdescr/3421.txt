When the rebellion of the Jotun Gygjas failed and the last of them retreated into the Iron Wood they were accompanied by a few loyal giants. When the Vaetti Jarldom formed the last Jotun warriors were given tasks the vaettir couldn't fill. One such task was boulder hurling. The Vaettir use bows and crossbows, but the sheer strength of the Jotun giants allows them to employ unconventional weapons. The hurlers carry large boulders, which they hurl onto heavily armed opponents or castle walls. Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning.
