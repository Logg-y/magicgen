The Eternal Knights swore to serve the Holy Father of Eldregate and were granted immortality. With the Fall of Ermor, they fought against their corrupted masters but were overwhelmed and imprisoned. With the re-emergence of Ermor, they escaped their infernal prison. Now they serve themselves and often fight for the highest bidder. The Eternal Knights wield great, flaming swords that shred the flesh of undead beings.
