Fomorians are a race of malicious and deformed giants descended from the cursed Fomorian giants. Many of them suffer from afflictions such as limps and missing eyes. Almost all are cursed with goatlike heads. Huge by human standards, they are far smaller than their ancestors. Fomorians use spears and armor of bronze.
