Eckhart was born in Kohlbrunn, one of the deeper reaches of Agartha. His father was an influential Servant of the Oracles. He followed in his fathers footsteps and became Kapitularvikar of the Tomb of Kohlbrunn. He soon became bored with his priestly tasks and began to explore the secrets of Old Agartha. As a priest he had both time and money to spend. He came in contact with a Ktonian Alchemist who wanted access to a deeper cavern closed by the priests. Curious he began to study the alchemy of the Ancient Ones. After having discovered the means to distill precious metals he abandoned his priestly career and moved his laboratory to the deepest possible cavern. After years of alchemical experiments he returned with unearthed secrets that would help Agartha in the upcoming war. The secret recipe of Cave Fire, as well as refined methods of distilling mercury are attributed to Eckhart. He has successfully prolonged his life through alchemical transmutations, but his mind has suffered a bit from exposure to noxious fumes and experiments on his own person. Eckhart himself claims that his mind is expanded and uninhibited by mortal constraints. As a result he can glimpse arcane secrets hidden to less exalted minds. Eckhart is also the first alchemist to create a barrel of living mercury.
