The Bear Warriors are the elites of the human hunter moiety. They gather at great pines adorned with bear skulls to feast upon uncooked bear flesh to incorporate the spirit of the Bear into their bodies. Bear Warriors do not transform into bears like the Chud Skinshifters, but they can enter a state of battle fury when wounded. They fight with two axes, much like the warriors of Ulm, but their skill is considerably greater. Bear Warriors are proud of their combat prowess and readily throw themselves into harm's way, but they are not used to following orders.
