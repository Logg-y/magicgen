The asp turtle is a giant dragon turtle that roams the sea. There are plenty of stories of fishermen landing on a small island that later turned out to be a sleeping asp turtle. When the fisherman lights a fire, the beast is roused and plunges into the depths. The asp turtle is probably the most powerful beast you can encounter if you stay out of the deep gorges in the ocean. The turtle is normally peaceful and lives in relatively shallow waters. Its huge size and heavy armor makes it easy for the turtle to kill smaller beings by trampling them.
