A mammoth is a stronger, woolly breed of elephant living in the icy vales of the Spire Horn. Due to their great bulk and thick, woolly fur, mammoths are resistant to cold. They are trained for use in battle by special handlers. The sheer size of mammoths is enough to let them trample soldiers and horses. Mammoths are intelligent beings with minds of their own. When hurt, they become enraged and terrified and will leave the battlefield by the shortest route possible. Friendly troops as well as enemies are knocked over and trampled during the rout of a mammoth.
