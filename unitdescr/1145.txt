The White Ones are the highest of the castes. They are white-furred Vanara who are gifted with superior mental capabilities. They are aloof and rarely concern themselves with matters of politics, but when they do, even the Bandar listen to their advice. A Yogi is a White One student of astrology. When a White One dies, his soul may transmigrate. Depending on the actions of the White One, he will reincarnate in a lower or higher form of existence. Truly enlightened ones might become one with the Awakening God.
