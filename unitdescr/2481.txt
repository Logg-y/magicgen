Nog, the King and the Clown, or the Ettin King, is a freak giant captured by a brave Knight of the Stone when it was still young. Brought to the king of Man for execution, the sniveling and crying baby giant was a cause for great amusement. It was given mercy and was reared in the palace to be ridiculed by the nobles. Over the years Nog has grown in size and strength. He has been given a crown and a fools hat and a tale to hold true. Now he is allowed to believe that the two of them command the great kingdom of Man. He is brought out of the palace once every year to receive the adoration of the crowds. Onions and turnips, his favorite food, are thrown at him by his subjects, and the king half of him rejoices as he is hailed as the greatest king in history. The fool head of his mutters that he would prefer a fish diet brought by tasty children. Nog is always accompanied by a retinue of guards that try to prevent him from doing too much damage to nobles and their possessions.
