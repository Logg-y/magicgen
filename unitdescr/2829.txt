The armies of ancient Therodos were vastly superior to their neighbors. Well-drilled hoplites clad in Telkhine iron conquered all lands that the God-kings would covet. When the Telkhine kingdom was shattered and drowned the skills of metalcrafting were kept by the Kaberoi guilds. Now, with the reemergence of Therodos, Kaberoi guilds once more make armors of plate for the soldiers of the kingdom. Therodian hoplites are living human soldiers recruited in newly-founded Therodian colonies. They have armaments superior to most nations, but their skills are average at best and they are not as skilled formation fighters as their predecessors.
