The Eagle Kings are the last remaining Yazatas, or 'Adorable Ones'. The Yazatas were semi-divine beings of an earlier age and the ancestors of the Caelians. When the Purifying Flames of Catharsis were corrupted by Death, the Daevas and Yazatas were punished by the previous Pantokrator and most fled to the Celestial Sphere. The few remaining Yazatas hid beyond the clouds of the highest mountains with their lesser kin. The Eagle Kings and their Seraphine servants brought the Sacred Fire of the White Forest with them, but with the ban on Fire magic only a few Yazatas still remember the ancient lore. From their palace the Eagle Kings rule their lesser kin and plan the reconquest of a world once theirs. Eagle Kings are surrounded by an Aura of Splendor that strikes mortals with awe. They have very long lifespans and are very powerful mages of winds and weather. They wear crowns and don enchanted golden armor.
