There are two faces of God in the Mictlan worship: The Dream Face of the Moon and the Watchful and Angry Face of the Sun. There are two orders of elite warriors corresponding to the two Faces. Moon Warriors are elite warriors who fight in the manner of the Moon, armed with swords of obsidian, a material of the night. They are blessed by the Moon and are almost considered sacred. Their blessed status has granted them night vision and increased resistance to magic.
