The tribe of Gad is a warlike tribe, partly because of its remote location. The Gadites have been exposed to Abysian raids for as long as anyone can remember. Exposure to Abysian armies has made the Gadites hard, but there is a more sinister truth to the story. The first Gadites were Humanbred refugees from the Abysian wastelands. Fleeing the bloody cult of the Anathemants, they are vehemently opposed to the equally bloody cult of the Kohanim. Few of the Gadites willingly come to the city of Gath. The Gadites' Abysian heritage has made them somewhat resistant to fire. Since coming under Gittite rule, they have lost their skill in ironworking, but they still make heavy armor of Abysian design. Their traditional color is gray.
