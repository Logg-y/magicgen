When the Avvim first encountered the Enkidus they were just large, hairy wild men with horns and unkempt hair who lived and frolicked with the beasts of the wilderness. They were captured and used as slaves due to their great strength and endurance. Slowly the slaves adopted civilization and eventually brought it to their homeland. In distant Ur the Enkidus became farmers and founded their First City in the image of Gomorrah. A rival nation slowly emerged under the rule of the Enkidu priest-kings. Enkidus are still hunted for sport and captured, but today most of the Enkidu slaves are born in captivity.
