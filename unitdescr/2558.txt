There are three Caelian clans. The Caelians of Spire Horn Mountain trace their lineage from the Kavi heroes of old. The Kavi Archers are the last descendants of the heroic ancestors blessed by the Yazatas. They are marksmen of unsurpassed skill and can fly during storms. The Kavi use armor studded with bronze, a metal closely attuned to thunder.
