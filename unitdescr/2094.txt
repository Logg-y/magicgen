Mori-no-kami are gods of the Jomonese forests. They tend to be boisterous and haughty, but sometimes take a liking to human visitors. Skillful archers who allow themselves to be defeated by the kami in archery contests might even be rewarded by the god. They rule their forests and everything that lives within. They can summon wild beasts to aid them in battles. Mori-no-kami will shrink and lose power if they leave their forest.
