In the deep forests of Ulm stands sacred Irminsul, an immense black oak older than the forest itself. It is tended by Antlered Shamans, priests and spirit guides of the wild dressed in hides, bones and an antlered hood. The Antlered Shamans are the highest priests of Ulm, skilled in the magics of Earth and Nature. By watching signs in the Great Oak, they divine the will of the Forest and the Awakening Lord. They are not often seen, as they rarely venture far from the Forest of Irminsul.
