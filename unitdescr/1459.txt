Deep down underneath the Cave City lie the Halls of the Oracles. Here a few surviving Ancients and their Oracles live in opulent halls adorned with statues and riches from the Earth. Awaiting the eventual demise of their proud race, the Oracles try to keep the old traditions and memories alive. By reanimating statues of their ancestors, the Oracles cling to memories of a glorious past when humans were not present in the Halls of the Earth and the Seal was unbroken. Some Oracles have even gone so far as to reanimate their dead brethren.
