Enkidus are large, hairy wild men with horns and unkempt hair. They live and frolic with the beasts of the wilderness and have only a vague notion of the concept of civilization. There are three Enkidu tribes. In the swamps lives a tribe known for their foul temper and cruel ways. They adorn themselves with bone charms supposed to give strength and protection from malign magic. They are able to go berserk.
