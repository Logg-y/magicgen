In the God Mountain resides the true power of Machaka. Here, Sorceresses and Black Sorcerers practice dark magic, train Spider Assassins and forge their deadly blades. The deeper caves of the God Mountain are restricted to the Sorcerers. It is said that the remnants of an ancient God are hidden in the deepest cave of the Mountain, a cave where no light is allowed. It is rumored that the Black Sorcerers are descendants of this Dead God. When they are seriously wounded, Black Sorcerers will turn into great hunter spiders. They are still able to cast spells in spider form, but have reduced magical skills.
