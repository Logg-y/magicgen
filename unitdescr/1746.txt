The Anusara is a Rakshasa, a demon-ogre of Lanka. It has a monstrous appearance with the head and legs of a donkey and the body of a muscular man with ape-like arms. It is very strong and can run untiringly with great speed through the forests. Anusaras do not eat flesh and can survive on a diet of scrubs and leaves. Anusaras are sacred to the monkey people.
