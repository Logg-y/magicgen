With the destruction of the Atlantian empire, the oldest fought bravest. The Mother Guards all perished defending their Queens and most war shamblers died as well. A few shamblers survived or fled the destruction and hid in isolated areas for a long time. When they were finally discovered by the Angakut, they were brought to the Coast of Ice and Bones to atone for their cowardice. Despised and ridiculed by the younger Atlantians who never witnessed the destruction of Old Atlantis, the Mournful do their best to serve their lords. The Mournful are Atlantians of the old kingdom and are not resistant to cold. They are given cuirasses made of bone instead of ice.
