The Triton race is ancient and Tritons have lived in the oceans since they were created in the image of some ancient god. The first of these Tritons were given exceptional powers and strength by their creator. The blood of these ancients is still strong in the royalty of Pelagia. The Pearl Kings have formed a sacral kingdom under their wise rule. They are mighty mages, powerful priests and able generals. Pearl Kings can summon hippocampoi, magical steeds of the deeps. All Triton Kings are skilled Water mages.
