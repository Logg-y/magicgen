Morgaine is a fay sorceress of unknown origin and great powers. She has appeared from time to time to aid or thwart the kings of Man, but she has always avoided the witches of Avalon. Some claim she is of tuathan descent and bears a grudge against the mistresses of Avalon. Others claim that Myrddin was her mentor, teacher and lover, and that her contempt for the witches stems from her tutelage under the mage. Morgaine is a shape shifter and can take the form of a large raven.
