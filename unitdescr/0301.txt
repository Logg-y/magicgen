The Astrologers of Arcoscephale are masters of star signs and divination. They reputedly gained their lore from the Rephaite of Kokabel. To consult the stars, they seek places of solitude and silence in the highlands where the stars are most clearly visible. Astrologers are masters of Astral magic and have a slight chance to prevent bad events in the province where they dwell.
