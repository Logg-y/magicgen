Zotz, the bat people of Xibalba, breed quickly and have lifespans far surpassing humans. When their cavernous realm was flooded the remaining Zotz settled in the dense forests of the surface world. They multiplied and rebuilt their colonies, but their numbers are limited compared to the swarming colonies of earlier ages. When the Muuch arrived it became evident that the toad people didn't pose any threat to the Zotz' life in the forest panoply. After a while the two species began to trade and eventually a symbiotic alliance developed. Now the surface colonies of Xibalba are composed of brown Muuch and their Zotz allies. Zotz are sensitive to cold and go into torpor if exposed to cold climates. Since they are almost blind and their perceptions are short-ranged they are not very efficient at patrolling. They use light obsidian tipped lances or twohanded obsidian club swords.
