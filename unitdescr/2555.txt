The Spenta Mainyu is the hypostasis of an Ahura, a celestial being of great might. During the reign of a previous Pantokrator, the Ahura was banned from this world. Now with the Pantokrator gone and the old decrees weakening, he has found a way to manifest his spirit as a divine messenger of the truth. Eventually he will reenter this world and claim it as his own. The Spenta is a spiritual being, able to appear wherever it wants. The Spenta Mainyu commands the six Amesha Spentas, divine manifestations of the Ahura.
