When the armies of Arcoscephale conquered the world they brought with them foreign faiths and beliefs. A group of mystics following a tradition of mystic poetry adopted new ideas of the transmigration of the soul. In earlier times there was not much speculation on the afterlife in Arcoscephale, but the Sibyls and the Orphic Mystics have changed this. The new perceptions of the soul and the dead have also marked the arrival of necromantic practices, such as the use of curse tablets. The lore of the Orphic mystics are collected in the Rhapsodies, mystical spellsongs and elegies associated with the cycles of life and death.
