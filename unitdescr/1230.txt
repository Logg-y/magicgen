The Titan of the Forge is a crippled God. Mutilated, imprisoned and given tools of smithing, he served the previous Pantokrator, but was forgotten and left for dead. During the aeons the Titan learned his craft and became a true master when it comes to forging magic items and mundane tools. Now his skills will serve both the farmers and savants of his kingdom. When forging magic items, he requires fewer magic gems than an ordinary mage. The Forge Lord has had a deformed foot since his days in the service of the Pantokrator.
