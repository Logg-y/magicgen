The Gigantes of Mekone have enslaved their neighbors and much of their armies are comprised of human slaves, helotes. Coerced into military service these helote soldiers have abysmal morale, and fear rather than loyalty keeps them in line. However, the Gigantes are few and the humans are numerous and expendable, so helotes have been given armaments to serve in wars for a long time. Helote Ekdromoi are the lightly armed hoplites trained to leave and reenter the dense hoplite formations and move with speed. They are often placed to defend the flanks of the hoplite phalanx. Helote Ekdromoi that show exemplary skills and bravery can be elevated to neodamode status.
