The Seraphines are female fire priests of the Airya clan. Fire has always been something rare and mysterious in the land of the ten month winter. The Seraphines kept the Purifying Flames alight in the White Forest before the Yazatas were banished from this world. When Catharsis, the spirit of the Purifying Flame, was corrupted by the Daevas and the wicked Mainyus, use of fire magic was restricted to the Airya priestesses. The Seraphines have been tasked by their Lord with purifying the banefires of the Underworld and return Anthrax to his former glory. In Caelum fire is sacred and must never be polluted by death, corpses or blood. Every fire is lit from the Sacred Flame of the White Forest of the Yazatas. The Seraphines keep the sacred fires of the ice temples alight and tend the frost flowers of the ice gardens. Each frost flower is said to hold the Daena of a dead Caelian, waiting for the touch of the Purifying Flame. The Seraphines perform the horrible ceremony of wing cutting and lead the Temple Guards into battle. Seraphines sometimes set up secret cults in human lands. Their wings and beauty allow them to present themselves as angels and divine messengers.
