The Divine Glyph is a divine spirit that manifests itself as a burning glyph. The sacred word is unutterable and unbearable to behold. Its very essence is beyond comprehension. At times, the spirit inspires a devout human to forge items and artifacts. Anyone trying to strike the blazing glyph will be punished with blindness. The Divine Glyph is a powerful wielder of Astral and Fire magic.
