The Vaettir are a people of small forest-dwelling goblins that once served the Jotun Gygjas of the Iron Wood. With the treason of the Jotun Jarls and the rebellion of the Gygjas the Vaettir abandoned Jotunheim and formed a Jarldom of their own, guided by the Gygjas. With the forming of the Vaetti Jarldom the Vaettir have adopted not only Jotun, but also human armaments. Vaettir are small and are unable to draw a long bow. A crossbow on the other hand is both easy to use and can deliver a devastating shot even if used by a small Vaetti. The Vaetti crossbowmen use light chain mail armors, but rarely use melee weapons other than simple daggers. All Vaettir are small and stealthy and can hide in enemy territories. They are somewhat resistant to cold, but their small stature makes it difficult for them to travel in snowy lands.
