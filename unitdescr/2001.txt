The Seranim are the rulers of Gath and descendants of the Anakim of Ashdod. They are old men of great stature, with pale complexion, six-fingered hands and long horns. They share temporal power with the Kohanim and lead the Gittites in acts of war, but have lost much of the innate powers of the earlier Rephaim. They wield ancient weapons enchanted by the Anakim in ages past.
