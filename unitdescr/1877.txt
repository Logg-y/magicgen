Throughout the Empire, mystery cults have spread and flourished with the influx of foreign culture. One of these, the Serpent Cult, has replaced the official state cult of the Theurgs, but many others ply their trade in secret. The Cult of the Sacred River of Death and Rebirth has become quite popular in the cities of the Empire. It is not as reclusive as many of the other cults and its C'tissian legacy has made it accepted by the Serpent Priests. The Renata, Reborn, is a female member of the Cult who has symbolically immersed herself in the Sacred River and entered the Realm of the Dead, a ritual mimicking the inauguration rituals of the Sauromancers. The Cult of the Sacred River is accepted and the Renata does not lead followers away from the Serpent Cult. She carries an urn and a golden pitcher filled with sacred water that harms undead.
