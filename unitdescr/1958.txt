Baba Yaga is an ancient hag of the woods. She is among the oldest beings in the kingdom and has aided more heroes than any sage and eaten more children than any dragon. Her appearance is that of a huge, shriveled old crone with teeth, nails and a nose of iron. Some claim her long, pendulous breasts are of iron as well. She is dressed in dark rags and her hair is long and unkempt. Baba Yaga is the most feared of all the beings of the wilderness. Her malevolence is unsurpassed, but so is her wisdom. At times she will aid questing heroes, at times she will eat them. Her boiling cauldron is always full of the tender flesh of infants. Baba Yaga lives in a hut with chicken legs, surrounded by a fence adorned with human skulls. Only very brave or very stupid heroes ever approach the hut. With the coming of the New God, Baba Yaga has seen the wisdom in limited servitude.
