The Anakim are pureblooded descendants of the Nephilim. They are deathly pale six-fingered giants with great horns and tremendous strength. They are considered semi-divine and sacred to the lesser Rephaim. There are three clans of Anakim. The descendants of Ahiman are the strongest and most fearsome of the Anakim. Their weapons are enchanted with ancient magic.
