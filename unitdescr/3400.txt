In Thrymsheim, the last castle of the Niefel Jarls, descendants of the frost giants still linger. Stronger than their kin and blessed with the cold breath of the Niefel Giants they have become the paragons of Jotunkin. Most of them live in Thrymsheim and are part of the hird of Tjatse, last of the Niefel Jarls. They are blessed by the Eternal Winter and are more powerful in cold climates. Like all Jotunkin they cannot stand lightning and fear thunder.
