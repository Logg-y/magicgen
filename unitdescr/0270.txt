The Arch Druid is a mage of such great power that he has mastered his own mortality. Donning a godly mantle, he has taken the role of a Pretender God. He is a master of magic and can be adept in several of the magic paths. The Arch Druid knows how to awaken the magical inhabitants of the forests and summons two extra vine men or vine ogres when casting the appropriate ritual spell.
