The Unfrozen are ancient undead warriors once imprisoned in glacial ice. They have now been freed by an evil mage. The Unfrozen have bony leathery bodies that withstand damage well. They fight with ancient stone spears, but some wield magical flint swords created by their mages. The Unfrozen are constantly surrounded by a wind of numbing cold.
