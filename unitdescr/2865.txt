To allow mermen some ways to prove themselves and give them opportunities to advance in status and recognition the Triton rulers of the kingdom have allowed the Order of the Closed Realm to form. The Order is a reformed and reinstituted remnant of a heretic order once located in the hidden lands of the Closed Realm. The leaders of the new order are able warrior-mages skilled in the secrets of the closed realm.
