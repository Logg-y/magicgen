An Ivy King is an ancient and exalted vine ogre. The Ivy Kings lived long before the coming of man, but fell into a deep slumber ages ago. The vine men followed their Kings to sleep and were all but forgotten. Now druids and powerful mages have discovered the means to reawaken vine men and their Kings. The Ivy King is skilled in Nature magic and vine men and vine ogres come in greater numbers when summoned by an Ivy King.
