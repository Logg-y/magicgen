Lapis is a member of the Closed Council. Emberstream, her sister, was the greatest Oracle of Waters ever to have lived, and her fame made Lapis jealous. She ventured down to meditate in the Womb of the Earth, like her sister had once done, but nothing was revealed to her. Frustrated and weakened she stumbled into the Chamber of the Seal. For unknown reasons the Seal Guard allowed her to pass and she came to face the Seal. The strange patterns seemed to beckon to her. Transfixed she sat down and listened to a whisper no one else could hear. After seven birth cycles her mind was released and she returned to the Halls of the Oracles. Something in her had changed and it soon became evident that her Oracular powers had improved. Her new found skills in the art of the dead were also noted, and she was eventually given a seat in the Closed Council where her sister already presided.
