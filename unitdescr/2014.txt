The Ammi is an Avvite sage and diviner endowed with the lore of the Watchers. Arakiel taught them the signs of the earth, Ezekiel the signs in the clouds, Kokabel the signs of the constellations, and finally Shamshiel the signs of the sun. Each Ammi practices the lore of one tradition. The divinatory skills of the Ammi can prevent bad events from happening.
