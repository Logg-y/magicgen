The Meliai are the semi-divine daughters of the Daktyloi. They formed a nobility of artists and performers unique to the Therodian culture. Their divine dances brought joy and stability to the land and became a means to rule. Human interpreters followed their processions and artistic works and human servants provided for them. With the fall of ancient Therodos most of them perished, but those that survived still linger on the sacred island of Telkhinis where they still lead their entranced brothers with the sound of songs and cymbals. The Meliai are blessed with their mothers' beauty and the few Arcoscephalians to have met them called them nymphs and daimones. The Meliai can enter the sea like their parents, but water is not their natural home.
