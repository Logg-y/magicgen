The Magnificent Kingdom of Ind has many subservient lands. Among them is the Great Feminie, a land ruled by a group of Queens and their Lady Warriors. Women hold power in the land and the soldiers and knights of the land are invariably female. Any man visiting a lady of the land is allowed to stay for nine days, but if he overstays he will die. Such are the customs of Great Feminie. Even though they are less righteous than the Soldier Priests of Ind, the Lady Warriors of the Queendom fight more bravely than the men of any other land.
