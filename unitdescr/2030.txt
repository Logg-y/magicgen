There are several races of giants in the land of Hinnom. The Rephaim are the sons of the Nephilim and the undisputed rulers of the land. They are huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers. They have been taught the secrets of war by their fathers and are formidable warriors. The Rephaim have gruesome appetites and many of them feast on the flesh of their smaller kin. They will devour food, beasts, men and kin and as long as there is population in a province, they do not starve, although the populace will suffer. They are much feared by the Avvim and Horim and are considered sacred.
