Zilammu is the only known female to have become a Sauromancer. She devoted her life to the study of life, death and rebirth during the time of Ekishnugal's reign, when magic was less formalized. She came to know Udum'ukinna, the son of the First King, and became his companion and lover until he was dismembered by Etimmu. Zilammu gave up her position in the Order and left for the Shaded Lands where she found and reassembled her lover in a great Ritual of Rebirth. Udum'ukinna became immortal, but true life was not returned to him. Instead, he lives on in a dried husk, incapable of love or tender emotions, and Zilammu and Udum'ukinna parted ways. Zilammu has returned to the Kingdom, but rarely aids the Sauromancers, whom she distrusts.
