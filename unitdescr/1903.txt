The Imperial footmen are skilled and heavily armed, but quite slow. To stifle uprisings, the Bureaucracy needed faster soldiers that were quickly deployable. Ministry footmen are medium elite infantry trained by the Bureaucracy that accompanies eunuchs and Ministers on their various missions in the Empire. Their training and loyalty is almost as good as that of the Imperial soldiers.
