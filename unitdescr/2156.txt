Centaurides are female centaurs. They are beautiful even where they are horses. Their coats are chestnut or white and glisten like those of horses well cared for. Quick and strong, centaurides have physical capabilities far superior to ordinary men. Centaurides use light bows to harass enemies with archery volleys. They are possibly even more skilled than their male counterparts. They are quite resistant to magic.
