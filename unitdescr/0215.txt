The Virtue is an angelic being, a divine messenger or servant stranded in the physical world since the disappearance of the previous Pantokrator. Winged and radiant with divine light, she will don the yoke of godhood for the people of the world, leading them on the path of righteousness and salvation. The Virtue is surrounded by a powerful Aura of Splendor given her by her former master.
