Keledones are singing statues of gold once made by the Titan of the Forge. Their songs are attuned to the music of the Spheres and they are constantly joined in an arcane communion. Now they adorn the palaces of Arcoscephale and Phaeacia, whose craftsmen and mages have learned how to replicate the wondrous automatons. Keledones have the form of beautiful women cast of pure gold. They are too heavy to be moved and cannot move on their own accord.
