A large portion of the human Nabaeans live pastoral lives and follow their own rulers unless called upon by their ‘Adite lords. Prominent caravan leaders blessed by the Jiniri Queens are respected as royalty by the human population. They lead the humans in trade and raids, but they rarely commit their men to full scale wars. This they leave to the ‘Adites and Nabaeans of the cliff cities. The Caravan Leaders can send their couriers with goods and treasures home to their Queens from faraway lands. Falconry is popular among the Nabaeans and most sheikhs own at least one falcon.
