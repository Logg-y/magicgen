Cavemen are overgrown humans of dubious mental faculties. They might be predecessors of the human race or just the result of a not so successful experiment of a curious divinity. Cavemen once lived in small tribes scattered all over creation, but have been forced into hiding in mountain valleys and caves. Cavemen are tremendously strong, but do not use metal weapons or armor.
