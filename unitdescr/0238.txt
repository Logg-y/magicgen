Panii are large beings with a ram's head upon a hoofed humanoid body. The Pan's hide is thick and furry and offers some protection. The Panii are lords of wild beasts and masters of Nature magic. They are enigmatic and are the most reclusive of Pangaea's inhabitants, living in remote groves and avoiding contact with other beings. The Panii shape the verdant greenery of the Sacred Groves with strange music produced from flutes and leave their groves only on orders from the Lord of Pangaea. Panii are said to cause both animals and men to panic and their flutes attract human females who shed all civilized manners to live a wild life of revelry. These females are called maenads. More maenads are attracted to a Pan in provinces with a strong scale of Turmoil.
