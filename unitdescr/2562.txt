In Caelum a person is comprised of four parts: The body, the soul, the Fravashi and the Daena. The Fravashi is a person's higher soul or guardian spirit. It follows the person from birth to death. It is distinct from a person's incarnate soul and it guides him in life until he attains his higher nature. At death the lower soul and the Fravashi is united with the Daena and a higher being is formed. There are three forms of Fravashis, the living, the dead and the yet unborn. Dead Fravashis are the souls of ancient heroes united with their lesser souls. They are revered and worshiped as messengers of the God. Living Fravashis can aid a faithful person's lower soul and body and protect him from harm.
