Eburhart came to sacred Irminsul when he was seven years old. He was an orphan and he and his master were on their way to the Wheel of Pain, when his master took a detour to consult the Antlered Shamans. When Eburhart approached the Black Oak, it sprouted leaves. It was the middle of winter and the shamans were amazed at the portent. Eburhart was taken as an apprentice of the shamans and quickly surpassed them all. He has since become Guardian of the Tree, chosen by the Awakening God. His skill in Nature magic and his priestly powers are unsurpassed in the kingdom.
