A Seithkona is a witch trained in Seith, an ancient form of sorcery, reputedly invented by Angerboda, the Great Hag of the Iron Wood. It has been practiced by females of the nation through the ages. Gygjor, Vaetti hags and human Seithkonur all have some knowledge of the Seith, but it is the Norns and Seithkonur of Utg√•rd that have mastered the art. Seith can be used to foretell the future as well as spell doom upon a target.
