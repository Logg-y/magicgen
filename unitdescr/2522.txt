In the beginning of time, the first humans lived in scattered tribes serving different gods. Three gods of remarkable powers gave their blessings and lore to their servants. There was a great war among the gods and the servants of the three gods waged war on the world. Only when the Pantokrator intervened was the threat of the three gods thwarted and imprisoned for eternity. Their servants suffered a similar fate and were entombed in the under-earth. Their prisons have been sealed for millennia, but powerful mages sometimes try to break the seals to release and bind these servants of the imprisoned gods. The Released Sages are skilled in earth, death and sometimes astral magic.
