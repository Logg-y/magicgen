The Warlocks of Abysia have experimented with crossbreeding since they first discovered blood magic. Under the influence of infernal magic Abysians, humans and giants are crossbred with demons, salamanders and other beasts. A Hell Spawn is the result of one such breeding experiment. In the earliest days most of the experiments were conducted on Abysians, but the wars with Hinnom occasionally made the blood of giants available. In later times humans and Humanbreds have dominated the breeding stock and Abysian crossbreeds are rarer. Due to the creation process many of the Hell Spawn suffer from various afflictions and premature aging.
