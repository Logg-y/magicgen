The Rusian society is divided into two moieties. Both humans and Chudes either lead their lives as nomadic hunters and warriors, or in small settlements. Marital traditions demand that no one marries within his or her own moiety. The human hunters of the wild moiety mainly use bows and spears as weapons. They are skilled but undisciplined warriors, good at moving unseen in the wild.
