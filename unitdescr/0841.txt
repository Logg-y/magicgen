Godihuskarlar are the personal guards of a Gode, handpicked for their skill and loyalty. Their Gode can often give them better armor than regular huskarls and they commonly use spears instead of axes. Javelin throwing is a popular way to show strength and physical prowess and many Godihuskarlar carry a couple of javelins into battle. Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning.
