Yamabushi are ascetic warrior monks of the Sacred Mountain. Enlightenment is found through the study and contemplation of oneself. This might include heavy drinking and unsavory behavior. The practice of martial arts is a means to perfection of body and mind and the Yamabushi are among the most skilled warriors in all of Jomon. Yamabushi live in isolation in search for enlightenment. Therefore they rarely fight in armies and are not as disciplined as the Sohei warrior monks. Some even consider them cowardly.
