When the Zotz emerged from their cavernous realm they found a world divided in four directions. In each cardinal direction guardians had been placed by some great being. The Chaac are powerful warrior spirits of thunder and rain. They have strangely elongated noses and blueish skin. They guard the subjects of the Awakening God with their thunderous might. The Chaac are connected to the four cardinal directions and have corresponding powers. The Yellow Chaac of the South brings Thunder and scorching hot winds to the enemies of the Lord.
