The Pearl Clan was the smallest and most secretive of the Triton clans. Few of them had any martial skills, but they were wise and skilled in the magical arts. When the Pearl Kings formed the Pelagian kingdom the Pearl Clan was given special status. With the magical skills of the Pearl Clan and the martial skills of the Coral Clan, Pelagia became a power to be reckoned with. Pearl Mages are powerful mages of Water, but they have also gained insights in the magic of the Spheres. The mages of the Pearl Clan have mastered the means of cultivating astral pearls in magically enchanted oysters.
