The Vanara are the third caste of Bandar Log. They are the most common of the four castes. They are about as big as humans. The civilized Vanara of the capital use black clothing and the gilded scales of their armor are sewn onto black linen to mark them as lower caste than the Bandar and the White Ones. The bow is the favored weapon of the Vanara, but chakram and maces are also used. The sword is considered the most noble of weapons and only elite swordsmen and captains use them.
