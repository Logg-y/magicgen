The Ilah is a giant of divine heritage. A previous Pantokrator placed the crescent moon on his brow and gave him mandate over all lands beneath the night skies and all life that begins during the long nights of the desert. When men realized his powers of fertility they began to worship him as a God. The Pantokrator was furious, imprisoned him for eternity and mankind was bereft of the fertility of the crescent moon. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Ilah is free to once more bring the gifts of the moon to the world.
