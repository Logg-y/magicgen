When human tribes first arrived in the land of the Tuatha they were few and came in small groups. Small tribes led by warrior shamans settled among the Fir Bolg and brought iron and steel to the land. They called themselves Logrians and shared traditions, but little else. When the Fir Bolg were defeated, Logrian petty kings tried to unite the tribes, but not until the witches emerged from Avalon was the realm united. The petty kings of Logris were replaced by the one king of Man. The warrior shamans were bereft of power and influence. Higher magic and the secrets of Avalon became restricted to women and male mages were all but persecuted. With time the Logrian shamans found a role as wise men and keepers of Logrian traditions. Few of them venture near the cities and castles of the witches and most resent their destiny and dream of the day the witches will fall. With the coming of the New Lord, the wise men have been requested to aid the kingdom and they have grudgingly answered the call.
