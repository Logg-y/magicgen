Oreiades are mountain spirits roaming the slopes and valleys of the sacred Mount Cephalos. They manifest as incredibly beautiful women. Few mortals would dream of harming an Oreiad. They are almost immortal and can live for millennia. Oreiades are curious beings who sometimes interact with the people of Arcoscephale. They are considered sacred and are powerful mages of the wild.
