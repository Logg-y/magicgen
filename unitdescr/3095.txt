The Ugallu are lesser storm deities of Enkidu legends. They have been revered by the Enkidus since before the founding of the First City and are called upon to smite the demons of evil. They appear as lion-headed men with donkey ears and bird feet. They command the weather and carry demon-slaying bronze daggers and flint maces that halts demons in their tracks.
