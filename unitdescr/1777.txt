Ferdiad is a Fir Bolg warrior of remarkable skill. In his youth he traveled far and wide to find the greatest warriors and learn from them. He eventually found the hidden isle covered in dread mists where Scathach reputedly lived. Scathach was a warrior woman, a descendant of the Morrigans who trained the greatest of heroes. He was taught how to win every battle and how to wake the fury inside. After he had spent a couple of years under the tutelage of Scathach, Cu Chulainn arrived. The two became friends and foster brothers, but Scathach prophesied that Ferdiad would fall before the spear of his brother.
