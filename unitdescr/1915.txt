Kenji is a Karasu Tengu, a mischievous being of the wild and the winds. He once befriended a young ronin and taught him the art of swordsmanship. His friend later started a martial school and became a well known and respected teacher. Kenji has since taken an interest in the lives and affairs of humans and has left his mountain home to be closer to mankind. The reverence given to him is flattering to the boastful crow and he has come to prefer the company of humans to that of his own kin. Like all Tengu, Kenji has power over the winds and weather and can fly during storms and unleash lightning upon his enemies.
