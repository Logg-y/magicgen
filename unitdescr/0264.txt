The leaders of Vanheim society are the Jarls. They are also the religious leaders of Vanheim and care for the sacrificial groves and administer the ceremonies. Vanjarls are closely attuned to their heritage and are skilled in the practice of Air magic and illusions. Vanjarls still remember the times when human blood was sacrificed to the gods. Vanjarls can sail with all units under their command across the open sea.
