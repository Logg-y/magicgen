The Wardens of Avalon were the sacred guard of the Witches of the Avalonian Age. With the Curse and the disappearance of the Witches, the Wardens were in disarray, but reformed as keepers of the Forest of Avalon. Now they guard the forest and prevent anyone from entering or leaving it. They wear green cloaks over full chain mail armor and wield great swords and crossbows. The Wardens have lost some of the magical strength granted to them by the Witches, but they are still warriors of almost unequaled prowess.
