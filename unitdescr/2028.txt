The Anakim are pureblooded descendants of the Nephilim. They are deathly pale six-fingered giants with great horns and tremendous strength. They are considered semi-divine and sacred to the lesser Rephaim. There are three clans of Anakim. The descendants of Talmai once lived in Kiriath Sepher, the City of Books, where the elders gathered ancient lore. The Talmai lost their home to a torrent of fire and were forced to seek refuge from the Abysian onslaught in the Twin Cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon. The Talmai Anakim are few in number and most of them have become scholars and craftsmen of remarkable skill. Like most Anakim, they adorn themselves with enchanted jewelry.
