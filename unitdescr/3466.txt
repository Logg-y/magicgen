Houris, The Fair Ones, are concubines and entertainers of the Sultans of Ubar chosen for their beauty and exquisite manners. They live sequestered lives in Jannah, the enchanted garden, and are rarely allowed to leave their paradise unless tasked by their Sultan to seduce or entertain a foreign diplomat or ruler. Houris are Jiniris and share the traits of pure-blooded Jinnun, such as glamour, invisibility and a strong connection with magic.
