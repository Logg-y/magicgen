Under the Roots of the Earth is an ancient chamber sealed by ancient spells. According to Agarthan lore, the Chamber contains three imprisoned gods of an earlier age. In the cavern halls near the Seal lurk dark and malign Umbrals. These caverns are taboo and guarded by the Seal Guards. No one is allowed to enter or leave the Halls of the Seal. The Seal Guards wear bronze armor and are armed with magical obsidian glaives that can harm the Umbrals.
