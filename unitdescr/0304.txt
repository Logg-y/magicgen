Devils are infernal beings of great strength. Only with human sacrifice is it possible to summon and bind these evil beings. Devils are born in the fires of the Inferno and are impervious to heat and flame. Their glowing bodies radiate heat and bat-like wings grow from their shoulders. Devils are armed with tridents and their barbed tails can sting opponents in close combat.
