Belphegor is one of the Demon Lords. He will serve his summoner, knowing that the summoner will surrender his soul when he dies. Belphegor is a seducer of men and uses gold to sow discord. Fathers sell their sons and daughters to the Demon and his host of corrupted souls is always growing. The presence of the Demon causes the faithful to forget their God and serve the beast. The Dominion of Pretender Gods wanes in the province where Belphegor passes.
