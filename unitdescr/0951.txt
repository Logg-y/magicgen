The Harab Seraphs are the black-feathered rulers of the Raptor Clan. With the coming of the New God, they have replaced the Airya Seraphs as rulers of the Caelian society. Their traditional training in the necromantic arts has not been abandoned, and some have secretly taken up Fire magic tainted by Death, an anathema once banned by the Celestial Powers.
