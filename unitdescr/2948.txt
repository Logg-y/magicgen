The erection of the Great Temple of the Moon marked the beginning of a new era. The influence of the Entu of the Moon came to eclipse the Entu-queens of the First City and the Ensis of the newly founded cities turned to the Moon for advice. The sacred marriage between the Ensi and the Entu of the First City lost meaning and astrological considerations replaced the fertility rites of old. The Entu of the Moon became the single most influential individual in the kingdom and now all of the Ensis heed her counsel. While Eridu retains its symbolic value it has lost much of its influence and the City of Gods has for all intents and purposes become the Sacred City.
