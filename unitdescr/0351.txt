Amazons are a people of semi-civilized tribes ruled by women. The Amazonian culture is centered around warfare and prowess in combat. The Amazon community is comprised of four tribes led by sorceresses and priestesses trained in magic. The Garnet Amazons are said to have sprung from an early breeding experiment of the Warlocks of Smouldercone. They are resistant to fire and use Blood and Fire magic as the Abysians do. They are more aggressive and arrogant than the other tribes.
