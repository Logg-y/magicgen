The Celestial Carp once dwelled in a decorative pond in the gardens of the Pantokrator. For eternities he lurked under the surface of those still waters, occasionally surfacing to spy on the ruler of all, learning forbidden names and the secrets of the divine. When he realized the Pantokrator had disappeared he decided to usurp the place of his master using the secrets he had gleaned during his patient wait. Used to feed on the flesh of those that displeased his master he has developed a hunger for the flesh of men, especially the clergy of other would be gods.
