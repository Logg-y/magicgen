A warrior of the Underworld reawakened to serve a necromancer, the wight is armed with a Bane Blade that will cause wounds to fester and flesh to shrivel. Wights are so closely connected with the Netherworld that they are surrounded by a wind of numbing cold. Wights are corporeal undead with leathery bodies that can withstand much damage.
