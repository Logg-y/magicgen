The Sideraspides, iron shields, are heavily armed mermen soldiers. Tritons are unable to leave the sea, but mermen can shed their tails and walk on dry land to trade or wage war. The extensive trade with Berytos has given Pelagia a much needed ally. In the few coastal cities Pelagia has built, Berytian infantry have helped in the defence. Over time the mermen have adopted Berytian and Therodian culture and tactics. Now there are few Berytian soldiers left in the cities and Pelagia fields its own mermen infantry. The Sideraspides are heavy mermen soldiers clad in Berytian iron armor. They are able to enter the sea, but as their armors corrode and fall apart with prolonged underwater campaigns, they mostly remain on land, defending or expanding the borders of the coastal colonies of the kingdom. The Sideraspides have slightly better morale than their turtle-shelled kin, but they are not as skilled formation fighters as their Berytian models.
