Bilqis is a Malikah, a Nabaean Jiniri Queen, of great renown. She has traveled far and wide and visited kings and queens of all four corners of the world. Like no other queen she impressed the Great King of Ashdod with the magic and riches of her people and showered him in gifts and marvels never seen before outside the hidden queendom of Na'Ba. Now she has returned to serve the Awakening god with her administrative and arcane skills.
