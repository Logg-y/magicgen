The Tlaloque are powerful rain spirits and high servants of the Awakening Lord. The Tlaloque are the ones who carry and open the Jugs of Heavenly Waters to let the Rain fall upon the Terrestrial Sphere. They are always accompanied by rainfalls. There is one spirit for each cardinal direction. The Tlaloque of the East brings rain of fertility and growth. The Tlaloque of the South brings warm summer rains. The Tlaloque of the West brings rains of fever and pestilence. The Tlaloque of the North brings rain storms and cold winds.
