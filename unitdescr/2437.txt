The Annunaki is a giant of divine heritage. During the reign of the previous Pantokrator he was shepherd of all things living, tied to the cycle of death and rebirth. With each passing year he was killed and reborn as the seasons changed. With the Pantokrator gone, he has defeated the cycle of seasons and will no longer suffer annual death and imprisonment. Now he claims to be be the shepherd of the entire creation and he will bring life to the world. The Annunaki is a god of growth and rebirth and supplies are never sparse in a land where he dwells. He is still affected by the changing of the seasons and is more powerful during the spring. Should a mortal be impudent enough to strike at his exalted form, roots and vines from the earth itself will protect the Annunaki and trap the puny mortal.
