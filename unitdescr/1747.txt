The Palankasha is a Rakshasa, a demon-ogre of Lanka. It has a monstrous appearance with the head and legs of a tiger and the body of a muscular man with ape-like arms. Palankashas are the most aggressive and violent of the Lankan Rakshasas and have made themselves rulers and nobles. They use swords and armor. Palankashas are sacred to the monkey people.
