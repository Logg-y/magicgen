A chieftain is the warchief of an unimportant tribe where women warriors have less power. They take their position by reputation and use flayed-man standards to show off their battle prowess. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The most common motif is the horse, but the Androphags are known to prefer serpent motifs.
