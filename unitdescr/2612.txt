The six great Daevas are divine demons and emanations of the Destructive Spirit. Each Daeva of the Heptad represents an aspect of their Lord, opposed to the Amesha Spentas of the Lord of Wisdom. Akem Manah is the Daeva of Evil Intentions and progenitor of Daevas. He is opposed to Vohu Manah, Spenta of Animals and the principle of good thoughts. The presence of Akem Manah will cause strife and disorder.
