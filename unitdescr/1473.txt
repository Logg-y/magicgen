Earth Readers are Agarthan priests and diviners of the Will of the Earth. Once the Earth Readers were Pale Ones, but with the slow demise of that race, humans have replaced them. Earth Readers are always consulted when new caverns or mines are opened. They also predict earth tremors and cave-ins by interpreting the ancient patterns and engravings found throughout Agartha.
