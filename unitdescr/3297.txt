The cannibal tribes subjugated by Ind are controlled by virtuous men, but if left unchecked the heathens return to their old ways and follow their Shaman Chiefs as they did before they became subjects of the Magnificent Kingdom. They feed on the flesh of men and prematurely born animals. The Shaman Chiefs have magical skills, but rarely use them for the good of the kingdom. Instead they tend to cause trouble and lead their tribesmen to acts of wanton destruction. Shaman Chiefs are quite bad tacticians, but can gather and lead large groups of cannibal tribesmen.
