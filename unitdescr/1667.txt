Malphas' early years are shrouded in mystery. He arrived at The Smouldercone and convinced the Anointed of Rhuax that he could serve them and give them even greater powers. He was allowed to form a new order of mages in the caverns underneath the Smouldercone. His adepts soon began experimenting with Blood magic and crossbreeding under the supervision of Malphas. Demons and devils are summoned from the Abyss and bred with Abysians to create half-demons born in this world. Malphas' influence has grown with his order of Warlocks and some paranoid Anointed fear that the Warlocks will remove them from power entirely.
