The Ah K'in is a solar priest and a keeper of the Vigil of the Sun. In ancient times the Zotz were tasked with guiding the sun on its passage through Xibalba. The order of the Ah K'in were once leaders of the Sun Guides and the old K'in cult. With the disappearance of the Sun they have turned the old practices into Sun worship. However, with the Sun being an unobtainable myth, the cult lost popularity and the Chilan priests of the dark caves have all but replaced the ancient priesthood. Only in the greater cities are the Ah K'in still influential. But now, with the imminent return of the Awakening God and the conquest of the surface world, the Ah K'inob predict a brighter future for their ancient order.
