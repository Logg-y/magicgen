The Vastness is an otherworldly being of almost godlike power. It is composed of spheres of stellar lights and shades. The Vastness can blast the minds of lesser beings and its touch steals the strength of living beings. Anyone who strikes at the Vastness is likely to be punished for his arrogance, taking damage himself instead of harming the Vastness.
