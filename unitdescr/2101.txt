In the courts of the Dragon Kings strange half-men dwell. Shrimp soldiers have served the Dragon Kings since they claimed dominion over the seas. The Shrimps once waged war against the Tritons of Pelagia, but now face the tainted dreams of R'lyeh. Shrimps have simple minds and simple dreams, and do not suffer much from the call to deeper slumber. Shrimp soldiers may appear clumsy, but they can use their tail to fling themselves out of harm's way. Shrimp soldiers cannot leave the sea.
