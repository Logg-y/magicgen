Ceremonial Masters were lowly priests of the Bureaucracy who served under the Ministers. In the Time of the Barbarian Kings, the Ministry lost much of its influence, but the Ceremonial Masters remained to perform the ceremonies in settlements across the Empire. Since there is no longer a religious calendar set up by the Ministry, Ceremonial Masters can no longer prevent bad events in their parish.
