The Father of Monsters is a hideous being born at the dawn of time, when the sea was untamed and filled with monstrous beings. He is the progenitor of the monsters of the sea and he claimed dominion over the dangers of the deep. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he banished or slew all that threatened his creation, and the Father of Monsters and his offspring were imprisoned for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, his shackles are weakening and the Monster that is the Sea once more threaten to swallow the world. The Father of Monsters wields an everburning torch made from lava from the deeper reaches of his realm. The Father of Monsters is able to leave the sea and can bring land-living beings with him into the sea.
