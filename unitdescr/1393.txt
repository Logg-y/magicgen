Bakemono are ghostly goblins of the mountain realms of Yomi and Shinuyama. The smallest of them are the Bakemono-sho, ugly, warty and brutal. They were slaves under the Oni of Yomi and their position did not much change with the coming of the Bakemono Kings. They are still at the bottom of their tribal society. They use crude weapons and armor. After the disappearance of the Oni, the Bakemono have adopted human weaponcraft and the Bakemono of Shinuyama use better armaments.
