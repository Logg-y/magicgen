Ryutaro is the Son of the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea and his mother is the daughter of a simple fisher man. When he grew up, it became evident that he had no mortal father. He was stronger, brighter and more skilled than the other villagers. When he slew a samurai who threatened his mother, he was hunted by the local Daimyo. He fled by boat, but was intercepted and thrown into the sea. But he didn't drown. Instead, he was taken to his father's abode and taught his true legacy. He has since returned from the sea as his father's ambassador. Ryutaro wields enchanted armaments given to him by his father. He is skilled in Water magic and can bring an entire legion with him into the sea.
