Satyrs are wild and emotional beings. While most satyrs are driven by their fears and lusts, there were once those who would lose themselves to battle lust and revelry. It has been a long time since these Revelers were heard of, but with the emergence of the new Lord, young satyrs have once again become filled with lust for battle and lust for life. Revelers cause unrest in the province where they dwell.
