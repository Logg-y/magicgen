Cynocephalians are dog-headed beast-men living in the mountains between Kailasa and the Sauromatian steppes. They dress in animal hides and live in caves instead of houses. They sometimes raid neighboring lands, but have never fielded an organized army, nor has there ever been a cynocephalian kingdom. Cynocephalian warriors fight with spears and javelins.
