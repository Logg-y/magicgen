'But for corruption thou hast made Belial, an angel of hostility. All his Dominions are in darkness, and his purpose is to bring about wickedness and guilt. All the spirits that are associated with him are but angels of destruction.'

Belial is one of the Demon Lords. He will serve his summoner, knowing that the summoner will surrender his soul when he dies. The Corruptor of Souls, Belial causes men to do evil and leads them away from virtue. His presence will cause unrest in entire provinces. He can pass unseen through enemy lands and spread his evil. Sometimes he takes the soul of an enemy commander who is loyal to his cause and flies back with him to serve a new master.
