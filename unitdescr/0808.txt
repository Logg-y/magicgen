Masters of the Way are lowly priests, hermits and sages who practice the ancient Magic of the Way. Some serve as parish priests and others travel the land, gathering followers. Still others sequester themselves in caves and practice extreme asceticism and self-starvation in the attempt to attain immortality. The practice of internal alchemy has given them remarkable longevity and they can survive on a diet of a few grains of rice per day. They all have some skill in Water magic, for the characteristics of Water, softness, flexibility and life-giving, are considered high ideals in the lore of the Way of the Five Elements.
