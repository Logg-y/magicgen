The Pontifices, Bridge Builders, were high priests of the Old Faith. They performed ceremonies and burn offerings to important Numina. With the coming of the New Faith, they had to adopt the new doctrines or suffer. The Pontifices lost influence and power, but are still important in the marginal areas of the Empire. The Bishops of Eldregate were never interested in keeping the Pontifices, but with the acceptance of the Flamen, the Pontifices were grudgingly accepted as well. The Pontifices have some skills in Fire magic. There is still rivalry between the remaining Pontifices and the Bishops.
