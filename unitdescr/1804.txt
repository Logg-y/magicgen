Balor is the undisputed ruler of all Fomorians. He ruled the Fomorian giants when they guarded the realm of the watery dead, he led them when they ravaged the world, he protected them from the invaders and he will lead them once again in conquest of this world. Balor is twice cursed. He is afflicted with a monstrous appearance, a single eye, skin as black as the night and a ravenous hunger. He is also cursed to be slain by his own grandson. This has led him to promptly imprison all of his daughters and their sons in guarded towers. During the conjuration of the plague that was to slay the Nemedians, Balor accidentally looked into the plague cauldron and the vapors lodged themselves in his single eye and turned it to evil. Now the gaze of Balor destroys the flesh of men.
