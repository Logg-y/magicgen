In the center of the First City lies an enormous temple ground. At the heart of the vast compound lies The House of Water, the high temple to the Wise Principle of the Waters Underground. Here priests and sacred warriors are trained. The Chosen of Enki are the sacred guard of the temple and serve as personal guard of the Ensi priest-king.
