The Perkunu is a Chud Thunder Priest Skinshifter trained at the sacred Pine of Skulls. For a decade the young apprentice will follow his master and only eat bear meat, wild berries and mead. When fully trained the would be Perkunu climbs a mountaintop and calls thunder to strike him down. If he survives he is blessed with the gift of shapeshifting and vast powers over storms and weather. The Perkunu are revered by all, but their skills as commanders and generals are lesser than the Chudes of the settled moiety.
