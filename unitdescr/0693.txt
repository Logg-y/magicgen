When a sacred serpent dies, it is mummified and placed in a small tomb. When the present Lizard King dies, the mummified serpents are removed from their tombs and buried with the king. A Tomb King can call upon his mummified serpents and give them false life. These reanimated serpents are called Tomb Wyrms. They are sacred and can be empowered by Grave Consorts and Tomb Priests. Tomb Wyrms are not poisonous.
