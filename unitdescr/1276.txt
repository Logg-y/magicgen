Kuro-Oni of exceptional strength and power are given heavy armor and positions as generals by their kings. An Oni Shugo is always guarded by three wolves that will appear as soon as an enemy approaches. Oni are demons and don't need to eat. However, they have tremendous appetites and like to eat and their human servants are often left starving if food is scarce. Oni are almost immortal. If their body is slain, their spirit will survive. If the spirit is not slain or banished as well, it will reform a new body over time. Their residual spirit form is a ghost and can be banished.
