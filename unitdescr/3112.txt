The power in Mekone is divided between the Basileus, the Archons and the Polemarchs. The Polemarch is a military leader and high commander of the Mekonean army, tasked with the downfall of pretending gods. They surpass their brethren in skill and devotion and are powerful wielders of battle magic. To accomplish their goal of deicide they wield god-slaying weapons forged by the Elder Cyclopes. The Polemarch is often accompanied by an Ephor to bless him with the might of the god-slayer.
