The Hounds of Twilight are stygian monsters spawned by the Mother of Monsters at the dawn of time. The greatest of them was fettered at the Gates of the Underworld to prevent the dead from returning to the land of the living. His siblings were lesser in might and were allowed to reign free. The beasts appear as black, two-headed hounds with serpent tails. They are huge and frightening to behold.
