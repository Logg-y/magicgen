Since the Angakut learned the techniques of ice crafting from Caelian captives, enchanted ice has been used to craft armor and weapons. Atlantians of the Frozen Seas are resistant to cold and can comfortably wear ice armor. Snow warriors are medium infantry equipped with ice cuirasses and ice lances or ice glaives. The ice cuirass tempers and hardens in cold climates.
