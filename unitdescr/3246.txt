Sojobo was the king of the sacred mountain of Kurama, a tengu kingdom rivaling the might of Shinuyama. When his tengu armies were defeated Sojobo secluded himself, meditated and grew wise beyond his peers. For centuries bakemono sorcerors have come to his lofty abode seeking his wisdom and advice. Now, with the awakening of the true God, Sojobo has foreseen the reemergence of the tengu kingdom and pledged his loyalty to the bakemono kings.
