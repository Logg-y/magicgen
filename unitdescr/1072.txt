Engineers are down-to-earth philosophers specializing in the physics and mechanics of that which is observable. They do not concern themselves with moral values or esoteric musings. Instead, they try to define the laws governing the universe and use their findings to invent practical things. Engineers are very skilled at siegecraft and castle defence. While philosophers prefer to stay at home or at the Academies, engineers often leave the Lykeion and travel throughout the kingdom to test their ideas and inventions.
