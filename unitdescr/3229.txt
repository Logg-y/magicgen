Enkelados was born in primordial times, the First of the proud race of Gigantes, who once declared war upon the gods of men. When his kin were defeated he was punished for his hubris and was cursed, deformed and trapped beneath the Burning Mountain. From time to time his primordial rage has unleashed eruptions of molten rock and lava. Now, he has finally broken free and the volcano beneath which he was imprisoned is sundered and gone. Enkelados is once more free to wreak havoc on men and Gods.
