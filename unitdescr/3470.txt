The human population of Ubar has little freedom and would be considered slaves by most standards. They fearfully serve their Jinnun masters, although most of them only come in contact with the Tubbas, human priest-king governors blessed by the Jinnun. The soldiers of Ubar are well aware of their masters dislike for iron, and use armaments of bronze to avoid arousing the ire of the Unseen.
