The warrior chiefs are the martial rulers of the tribes of Ulm. Every tribe is led by a chieftain, a shaman and a smith. The chieftain rules in matters of war, the shaman in spiritual matters and the smith in judicial matters. Warrior chiefs are skilled warriors and able commanders. They wield heavy two-handed swords and wear scale mail armor.
