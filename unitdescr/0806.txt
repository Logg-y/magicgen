Good standing with one's ancestral spirits is of utmost importance in T'ien Ch'i. The Master of the Dead is a lowly priest or spirit master who divines the will of the ancestral spirits. They have some skill in exorcism and communication with the dead. They often carry papers inscribed with sacred texts. Weaker unholy beings hit by a thrown sutra are paralyzed by the holy words.
