Shamblers are Atlantians grown to huge proportions. They use claws or clubs made from Atlantian coral in combat and do not normally don armor since it tends to be cumbersome. The shamblers have lived long enough to grow accustomed to the comforts of life and do not join armies unless generously paid. Shamblers are very strong and do not fear shorter beings.
