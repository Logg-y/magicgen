The Eponi tribe is the only tribe that uses horses in warfare. It is a small tribe and only the nobles who can afford a horse and armor join the armies of the Marverni. The knights use Marvernian chainmail and broad swords. They also carry javelins. Like the other tribal chieftains, Eponi Chieftains inspire their tribesmen to great deeds. The Eponi tribe decorate themselves with enchanted horse tattoos.
