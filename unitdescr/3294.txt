The Magnificent kingdom of Ind has armies of brave and righteous men, but it is not they who wage the wars of the kingdom. Instead it is the heathen tribes subjugated by the Prester King who in times of war are unleashed upon the world. There are many cannibal tribes serving the Prester King. The Agrimandri of the mountains are known for their skills and use of sword and shield. The Agrimandri, like all cannibal tribes under Ind's rule, are frighteningly efficient plunderers.
