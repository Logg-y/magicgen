The disease demon is a bringer of disease and illness. It feeds on the prayers and promises given by the despairing victims of its fevers. Its mere presence causes healthy men to cough and shiver. Evil demonologists summon these demons and send them to haunt their enemies. The disease demon is ethereal and winged.
