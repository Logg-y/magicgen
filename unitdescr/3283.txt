In Magnificent Ind every soldier is a priest and every lord is a king. When the armies of Ind go to war every soldier will bless his brother and himself and enter the battle wielding the righteous might of the Lord. In front of the Sublime Palace lies a great Onyx Court. Such is the nature of the onyx gem that its mere presence grants morale and combat prowess. Observed by the Prester King himself young priests exercise and hone their combat skills on the Onyx Court until deemed worthy to join the armies of Magnificent Ind.
