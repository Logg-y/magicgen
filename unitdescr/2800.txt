The Ormr is a monstrous serpent born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Great Serpent was imprisoned for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the Ormr is once more free to roam the world. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds, and the Ormr is no exception.
