In the C'tissian society, predator lizards are considered stupid, aggressive and untrustworthy. Members of the predator race are enslaved and forced to perform manual labor. Their temperament and strength make them well suited for combat, so they are trained in warfare by special Taskmasters. The slave warriors are armed with tridents and can use their jaws to bite opponents in close combat.
