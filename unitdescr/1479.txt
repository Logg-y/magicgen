The Konoha Tengu is a sacred being of the mountain winds. It has the appearance of a man with a very long red nose and the wings of a crow. It is more civilized then the Karasu Tengu. While not as skilled as the Karasu Tengu, the Konoha Tengu is still a formidable swordsman. All Tengu have power over the winds and weather and can fly during storms and unleash lightning upon their enemies.
