Huskarlar are the personal guards of a Herse, handpicked for their skill and loyalty. They are often better armed than the regular farmers and fighter at a Herses command, but their Herse can rarely afford to give them heavy armor. Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning.
