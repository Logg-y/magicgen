Soothsayers are Sauromatian diviners. Sauromatia is a warlike society and many older warriors and other weak men turn to prophecy and divination to find a place in their tribe. These soothsayers influence much of the tribal wars and politics of Sauromatia. Soothsayers are not fully trusted, though. If one is suspected of fraud, three other soothsayers are called in to pass judgment on the suspected charlatan. If found guilty, he is fettered on a wagon together with his sons and set on fire. This practice ensures the loyalty of soothsayers, but has also resulted in animosity between them. Soothsayers have a slight chance of preventing bad events in provinces where they dwell.
