When the Zotz emerged from their cavernous realm they found a world divided in four directions. In each cardinal direction guardians had been placed by some great being. The Balam are powerful jaguar-shaped spirits of fertility and servants of the Awakening Lord. They protect and guide his subjects and will wage war on his enemies. Once they brought maize to mankind, but the Zotz have different appetites, shared by the Balam. Now the hunt will begin. The Balam are able to change their shape at will. To the Zotz they often appear as Onaquis or Zotz sorcerers, but in battle they take their true form. The Balam are connected to the four cardinal directions and have corresponding powers. The Balam of the South has some skills in fire magic.
