The Sultans are the oldest and mightiest of a race of mighty beings. Born from Smokeless Flame and endowed with vast magical and physical powers they have ruled Ubar since the coming of man. Most of the Sultans live sequestered lives in the opulent palaces of the City of Brass, visiting the Houris of Jannah and feasting upon dates and grapes of unequaled flavor. When distracted from these pleasantries, the white hot ire of the Afarit flares and they emerge to wage war upon those who would disturb their flawless lives. The Ifrit Sultans are Afarit and share their traits, albeit more powerful. They are innately powerful wielders of Sahar, the sorcery of the Jinnun, and can unleash unrivaled destruction upon men.
