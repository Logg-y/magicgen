The Handmaiden of Death is an angelic being of hideous appearance. She once served the Lord of the Underworld as an executioner, but has joined the Black Coven for personal gain. The Handmaiden of Death appears as a semi-transparent, winged female drenched in blood. She wields a Wraith Sword that drains the life from those it strikes.
