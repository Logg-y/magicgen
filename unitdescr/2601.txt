While most Turans are of Humanbred stock, there are a few remaining pure-blooded Abysians in the kingdom. These families have preserved the old Abysian magic and jealously guard their secrets. They form a sorcerer-caste of powerful mages, influential in the courts of the Turan Shahs. With the arrival of the Airyas, some of them have turned their attentions towards magic not previously used by the Turans. The Sorcerers can only be recruited in hot provinces.
