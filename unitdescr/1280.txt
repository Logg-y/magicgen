With the return of the Raptors, the Wingless of Ravens' Vale were rewarded by the victorious Harab Seraphs. The old ice temples were replaced by mausoleums of stone and iron and the Wingless were placed as guardians of these new temples. A sacred military order was formed and the old Temple Guard was replaced by the Earthbound who were bereft of flight, not as an act of will, but as an act of divine intervention. The Earthbound draw strength from the earth and are reinvigorated as long as they touch the ground. They fight in heavy plate armor and use crossbows to fire a volley of deadly bolts to weaken the enemies before they engage in melee.
