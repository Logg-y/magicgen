In the depths of The Wormwood lies an ancient ivy-covered castle, hidden by illusions and mighty enchantments. This is the place where the Wormwood Witches gather. Their coven is one of the oldest and possibly the most influential of all circles. The Wormwood Witches are skilled in Air, Nature and Death magic.
