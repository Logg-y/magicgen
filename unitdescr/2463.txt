The Statue of War is a primordial spirit of strife and turmoil once bound in a huge stone statue by a previous Pantokrator to save the world from its destructive influences. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers are unleashed and strife and war have once more come to the world. Barbarian warriors gather in the land of the statue to wreak havoc and plunder. More barbarians arrive if the turmoil of the province is high. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.
