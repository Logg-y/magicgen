Carnon, the Antlered One, is afflicted by an ancient curse. Instead of a human head, he has the head of a stag. Carnon grew up far from the sacred Forest of Carnutes, but wanted to become a Boar Warrior. Unfortunately, he was Marverni by birth and was not allowed to enter the sacred forest. He defied the Druids and entered the Forest full of rage. Deep inside Carnutes he found an ancient hill with a westward opening. Outside the opening stood a huge boar with sentient eyes. Carnon promptly slew the boar and entered the tomb. Inside lay the remains of an ancient warrior clad in gold. While a thunderhead was building up outside, he donned the armor of the entombed warrior. Armed like a warrior from the past, he emerged from the tomb, raised his hands and was struck by lightning. When he came to, he was changed, possessed and cursed with the head of a stag. Carnon returned to the Druids and was given soldiers to lead. Now he serves the Druids with unfailing loyalty.
