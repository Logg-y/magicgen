The awakening of the Vengeful Woods has altered the very essence of Pangaea's inhabitants. Dryad Hags were the first of these black dryads. When they first appeared it was an event of great alarm and the young kids were contained or exiled. Soon it became evident that it was not a singular event. Other half-men with black hides, mirroring the dark mood of the Vengeful Forest were also born. The half-men of Pangaea were divided and the exiles and the discontent formed an emerging power that threatens the civilized world. The dryad hags are old, sly and harbor a relentless hatred of the civilized world. They have completely lost the beauty-inspired aura of awe of the white dryads.
