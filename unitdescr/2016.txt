The Qedestim are male Avvite temple servants. They are chosen for appearance rather than intellect. Although ordained as priests, their main function is another. Rephaim are allowed to use and be blessed by the Qedestim for a small fee. The Qedestim are sometimes brought along to bless the armies of the Rephaim.
