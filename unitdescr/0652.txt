The Void Lord is an otherworldly being that spawned in the Void. It was worshiped on that strange and distant star from which the great race of R'lyeh came. Once this world was protected from the vile beings of the Void by seven Seals placed by the Pantokrator, but when the Pantokrator disappeared a star fell upon the world and the Seals were shattered. The things from beyond began to manifest and the Void Lord was drawn by dreams to the world men. Now the Starspawns of R'lyeh have made contact with their distant and slumbering God and eagerly await the Awakening.
