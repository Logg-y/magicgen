In the center of the First City lies an enormous temple ground. Here priests and sacred warriors are trained. The Gala is an elegist, a lamentation-priest grieving the untimely dead and the dying god. Her dirges and lamentations will open the gates to the Underworld and allow the imprisoned god to return to once more bring fertility and prosperity to the land of Ur. When recalling a dead god the Gala counts as being two levels higher than her ordinary priest level.
