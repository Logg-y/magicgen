The Kulullus are an ancient race of strange beings whose bodies resemble a combination of Enkidu and fish. The Kulullus have lived in the seas near Ur since before the First City was founded and they claim to have founded the first kingdom underneath the waves. Sages believe that when U'an the Apkallu emerged from the sea to bring civilization to Ur he had already brought his gifts to the Kulullus. But war and strife brought by less peaceful beings almost destroyed the Kulullu kingdom. Kulullu myths claim that an apostle of U'an will one day arrive from dry land to rebuild the old Kulullu kingdom.
