The Chayot, living beings, are high servants of the Celestial Sphere. They will only manifest as part of the Merkavah, the Divine Chariot. They serve the Reawakening God as he chose to claim this world as his and proclaim His Glory. The Chayot are surrounded by a blaze of unbearable splendor. At the center of the brilliance stands an angelic being with four wings, four faces and four colors. The Tetramorph have powers over the four cardinal directions and each face beholds all that passes under its domain. The divine might of the Chayot is so vast that it cannot be contained in a singular physical body and only one form of the Tetramorph is manifest at any time. The human faced form of the Chayot has power over the stars and constellations. If harmed it will remanifest as an eagle-faced form with the power of the skies. If this form is harmed, it will transform into a lion-faced being with the power of the sun. Finally, if this form is harmed, it will take an ox-faced form with powers over the earth and mountains. Only then can the Chayot be destroyed.
