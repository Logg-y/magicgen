When nurtured by the Polypal Mothers, some spawn get a different kind of nutrition. Whether this is caused by an act of will or randomness is not known, because the Mothers do not speak, they only scream. The spawn are given special care and soon develop a bond with their Mother. Small tentacles sprout around their mouths and they use them to search the ocean floor for life force needed by the Mothers. The Gibodai consume life force and accumulate it for their Mothers. Some suspect that the Gibodai and their ability to steal and carry life force is the key to the power of the Aboleths. Gibodai and their task are sacred to the Aboleths.
