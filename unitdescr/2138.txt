The Sphinx is a guardian spirit given divine might by a previous Pantokrator. It has realized the aspirations of the other Pretenders and will protect its subjects by donning the mantle of God itself. It has the appearance of a great winged lion with the head of a woman. The Sphinx is attuned to the powers of the stars and the Underworld.
