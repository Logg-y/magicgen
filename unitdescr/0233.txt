When the ways of man came to the ancient woods, the centaurs were the first to adopt the new ways. They donned bronze armor and fought in formations like the soldiers of other nations. As civilization spread, the centaurs forgot the old ways in their attempt to mimic human society. The centaurs who were the quickest to adopt the new ways are distrusted by the other halfmen, but their strength in battle is undisputed. Centaur cataphracts don bronze plates and fight with light lances.
