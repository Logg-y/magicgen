The Bodhisattva is an enlightened being and messenger of the Heavenly Sphere. When she interfered with the world, the previous Pantokrator imprisoned her and she was bereft of her identity. For millennia she traveled the land and was reincarnated time and time again in different forms in her quest for enlightenment. Now with the Pantokrator gone, she has reacquired enlightenment, but during her exile in the mortal realm she came to love the world and those who live in it. She now claims this world as hers to guide all beings on the path to enlightenment. The Bodhisattva travels on a heavenly lotus and is surrounded by sacred prayer scraps that banish illusions and false perceptions.
