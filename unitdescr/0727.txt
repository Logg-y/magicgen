The sacred Jaguar Warrior dons a jaguar hide in battle. He wields a great club of wood that has been fitted with obsidian shards to give the weapon a sharp edge. When a Jaguar Warrior is wounded, the blood from his wounds will cause his sacred jaguar hide to merge with his body. This merging results in a fearsome were-jaguar. When transformed, the Jaguar Warrior drops his obsidian sword.
