Gladiators are slaves trained to fight in the arena for the Emperor's pleasure. Gladiators who survive become very skilled in combat and often use exotic weapons. In times of crisis, they can be used in warfare in return for their freedom. They are quick to levy, but will only fight until they have been wounded or hit someone in battle before leaving.
