The Ahu is a Daevic Lord. Daevas were demonic beings of an earlier age and the ancestors of the Mairya Clan Caelians. Their power was broken by the previous Pantokrator and they were banished ages ago. Daevas arm themselves with spears and bucklers and don enchanted golden armor. They are attuned to fire and are surrounded by an aura of fear. They are servants of the Destructive Spirit and their powers are greater in lands of turmoil and strife.
