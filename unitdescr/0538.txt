The Theurgs of Pythium are masters of arcane communion. This communion allows them to cast more powerful spells in combat. Theurg Communicants are acolytes trained in the Theurgical arts. They lack the arcane skills of true Theurgs, but are able to strengthen the magic of senior Theurgs by acting as communion slaves. The Communicants automatically cast the Communion Slave spell before combat, ready to lend their strength to the senior Theurgs.
