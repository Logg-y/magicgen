The elites of the Phlegran armies are the Cyclope Soldiers, but a large part of the armies are made up of human slave soldiers. A slave soldier that shows initiative, cruelty and loyalty can advance and gain a position as commander of the Phlegran slave troops. These slave commanders are rarely allowed to leave their armies and few of them see the comfort of city life, despite their position in the slave hierarchy. Phlegran commanders, like their troops, have abysmal morale and fight mainly to keep their privileged status.
