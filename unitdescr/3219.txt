The Cataphract Commanders are slave commanders that have advanced in skill and rank. In the slave hierarchy of Phlegra they wield power and influence and are expected to whip their troops into cohesive and unfaltering units. They ride mighty mouflon steeds and lead the Mouflon Cataphracts with an iron fist.
