The Angra Mainyu, Spirit of Destruction, was given half the world by a previous Pantokrator. While his wise twin was appointed as the guide of men and claimed as followers those who did good deeds, the Angra Mainyu became the lord of the wicked and the cruel, worshiped by sinners and deceitful men, and he would tempt and lead astray those who followed his benevolent twin. When the Pantokrator finally tired of the game of the opposing principles, he imprisoned them both for eternity. But now the Pantokrator is gone, and the Angra Mainyu feels his prison weaken. Now he will rule this world without an opposing principle to stop him.
