Serpent Priests are the leaders of the Pythian Serpent Cult. The Serpent Cult is one of the many mystery cults that spread to Pythium during the collapse of Ermor. Sauromancers from C'tis were invited by the Emperor and his Theurgs to battle the growing threat and with them came the Serpent Cult. The Serpent Cult was heralded as the answer to the Ermorian threat and quickly received Imperial acceptance. Soon it replaced the Order of the Theurgs as the state cult and grew in influence and power. In the years that have passed since the lizards left Pythium, the Cult has changed. Serpents are venerated and the priests of the Cult wear serpent masks and carry serpent staffs as signs of their office. Serpent Priests constantly expose themselves to poisons and their skin has a deathly pallor. They are able to train Hydra Hatchlings in any temple that has access to a swamp.
