The King of Elemental Earth is a physical manifestation of the wild magic of the Earth. Barathrus has a body of stone and soil and appears as a huge, crowned humanoid. He is innately skilled in Earth magic and can summon earth elementals from the deeper reaches of the world to serve him. From his body seeps Earth Blood that crystallizes into gems of Earth power. The King draws power from the ground and regenerates his wounds. Only three Kings of Elemental Earth are known to exist and one of them has been tainted by Blood magic.
