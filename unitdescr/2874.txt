The Telkhines are ancient daimones, spirits of the sea, with powers to rival the titans. They were able to change their shapes and left the sea. They formed a mighty kingdom and made themselves god-kings to be worshiped by their subjects. The Telkhines were masterful sages and invented metalcrafting. They forged artifacts for the servants of the previous Pantokrator and taught the elder Cyclopses their arts. When they discovered the means to create malefic poison through the mixing of stygian water and sulfur their lands became poisonous to animals and plants alike. Their reign was put to an end by divine intervention and the entire kingdom was swallowed by the sea. The Telkhines themselves were imprisoned in Tartarus for eternity. Only with powerful rituals is it possible to call back the old Gods of Therodos. Telkhines are able to change their shape. In their demonic form they appear with dog heads and flippers instead of hands and their powers over storms and the sea are increased. In human shape their skills in forging are increased. Telkhines are always surrounded by stygian fumes that kill men and beast alike. Even the population in the province where they dwell will slowly suffer and die.
