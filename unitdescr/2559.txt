Once the Raptor Clan was known as the Mairyas. They served the Daevas and wicked Mainyus. With the fall of the Purifying Flame the Daevas were banished from this world and the Mairyas found themselves without leadership. Much of the old ways were lost and the Raptor Clan all but disappeared. With the emergence of the Eagle Kings the Raptors were allowed to redeem themselves and were accepted by the other clans. With the arrival of the new God they have resurrected the old ways and formed a sacred warrior caste to impress the last of the Yazatas. They have taken the old name of Mairya to instill fear in their enemies. When a Raptor is born with black wings, it is a sure sign of greatness and the youngster is trained either as a Harab Seraph or a Mairya Warrior. The Mairyas of old were known to pillage, raid and plunder. The Mairyas of this day do their best to live up to the old ways.
