A Kohen is a priest. Since they are the sons of Gods, the Rephaim were not much concerned with religion. To keep the Avvim loyal, a cult of Nephilim-worship evolved in Hinnom. With the coming of the True God, the Rephaim have found themselves accepting the yoke of religion. The Kohanim have turned their ceremonies and misplaced worship to new practice. The Kohanim now preside over a growing cult with adherents among the Rephaim as well as the Avvim.
