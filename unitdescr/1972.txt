Deep in the Smouldercone, the Warlocks of Abysia experiment with their brethren to create superior beings. The Warbred are the crown of the Humanbred experiment. Bred for strength and obedience, they make perfect soldiers. Unfortunately, other less important abilities have been lost and they are stupid at best. However, their slow minds are quick to anger and they become enraged at the slightest provocation. The Warbred serve only one purpose and have not been bred for longevity. Those who survive military campaigning will die in their early twenties from old age. The Warbred have lost some of the Abysian resistance to fire.
