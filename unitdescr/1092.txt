With the magic heat of the Smouldercone seeping from the land, the Anathemants are looking for other sources of power. The ancient practice of blood sacrifice has been renewed and a new order of Anathemants formed. Only pureblood Abysians are allowed to gain full priestly status in the order. The Sanguine Anathemants have the priestly powers of the regular Anathemants and are in charge of the growing Blood Cult. They have limited skills in Fire magic.
