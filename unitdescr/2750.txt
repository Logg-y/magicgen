The Chilan is a Xibalban priest of the caves and the dark. When the Zotz returned to their ancestral home the Chilanob rose to power. The Ah K'inob and their sun-maddened dreams died a long time ago and in their wake the Chilanob claimed religious authority. The Chilanob were the ones who disturbed the depths and awoke the Bacabob. Now they serve the ancient ones as priests and oracles. Their masters have taught some of them the secrets of subterranean waters. Through necromancy and geomancy they predict events to come and guide the Ajaws with their advice. They sometimes perform blood sacrifices, but usually this is left to the Ajaws.
