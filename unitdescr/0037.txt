The Master of the Games is an old gladiator who has remained with the Legion after he was granted freedom. He is almost unequaled in combat but is a rather poor leader. Since his great victory in the Pythian arenas he has dreamed of fighting in the global arena death match and will always compete there if possible. He is always accompanied by loyal old friends from the arenas.
