The Muuch are descendants of the Atlantians that invaded the Xibalban caverns after the great flood. They resemble toads and have become known as toad men, although they have some fish-like traits as well. The magic of the star that fell into the ocean and flooded Xibalba transformed the Atlantians, or perhaps it was the will of the Awakening God that manifested itself. In any case, the Muuch have become more toadlike since they settled in the flooded caverns and some have evolved other traits previously not found in Atlantis. One particular breed of Muuch have developed brown hides and adopted to life at the forest floor. They are known as Jungle Warriors and they live in a symbiotic relationship with the Zotz of the forest panoply. The Jungle warriors are stealthy and they often raid enemy territories together with their Zotz allies.
