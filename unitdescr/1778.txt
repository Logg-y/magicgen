Cu Chulainn is the greatest hero of the realm. He is not of Sidhe origin, but has divine blood in his veins. His deeds are too numerous to count and his battle prowess is unequaled. His divine heritage has blessed him with a fiery aura that melts ice and makes water hiss and steam, should he take a bath. Those who oppose him are struck with awe and fear of his flaming battle fury. He was trained by the warrior woman Scathach on her hidden isle. There he met his friend Ferdiad, whom Scathach prophesied he would kill. From Scathach Cu Chulainn received the enchanted spear Gae Bulga, made from the bones of an asp turtle, after he defeated and raped her enemy Aoife.
