The Androphags are a small Sauromatian tribe feared and shunned even by other Sauromatians because of their gruesome practices. Not only do they flay their enemies, they feed on them. The practice of cannibalism was introduced by the Witch Kings and the tribe has been called the Man Eaters ever since. While Sauromatians are skilled horsemen, the Androphags live near the swamps of Pythia. Horses are rare in these environs, but serpents are common. The Androphags have found the serpents to be formidable mounts. Androphags are feared and revered by other Sauromatians and are considered sacred. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The most common motif is the horse, but the Androphags are known to prefer serpent motifs.
