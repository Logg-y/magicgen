When Ermor was defeated with the aid of the Infernal Lords, a new cult and a new order of mages emerged. The Goetic Adepts are higher members of the diabolical cult that tries to placate the Infernal Lords. They are skilled in Fire and Blood magic and their blood hunts have made them almost as feared as the inquisitors. Devil worship and the summoning of devils are still tightly controlled by the Inquisition and Goetic Adepts must apply for summonings at the nearest cathedral.
