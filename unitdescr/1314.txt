A Demon General is a human general who serves the Oni Kings by coercion or free will. Oni are powerful, but not very bright, so human tacticians are needed if the Oni Kings are to conquer the world. Demon Generals are given dark powers to command demons and the dead. Because they are invaluable, they are given armor that the Oni themselves rarely use.
