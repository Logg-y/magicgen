Since Rhino was defeated by the metal spears of Hyena, his followers have adopted metalcrafting and wear scale armor to mimic the tough hide of their totem. Rhino Clan Warriors are slightly taller and stronger than most Machakans, but they have small squinting eyes and are generally considered ugly. Their commanders do not have the strategic skills of the Lion Clan.
