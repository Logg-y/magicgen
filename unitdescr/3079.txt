The Duiu of Thunder is a giant of divine heritage once given mandate over thunder and the shifting seasons by a previous Pantokrator. He was given divine regalia to match his mandate, the Wheel of the Turning Year and the Thunderbolt. With the power to mete out thunderous justice, combined with the power to influence that which is important to mankind, namely the harvests during fall, the cold and death of winter, the return of life in the spring, and the growth of summer, his influence over mankind was greater than the Pantokrator's other servants. Hearing the pleas and prayers of men his hubris grew and he accepted worship from mankind. Furious the Pantokrator imprisoned him for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone his prison is failing and mankind can once more trust in the cycle of the Turning Year.
