In every cardinal direction the Sky and the Earth meets, and in each of these places there is a dwarf of vast powers holding the Dome of the Sky in place. Should any of these dwarves be tricked to leave their task the world would start to collapse and storms would ravage the world. It is believed that wicked giants and Seithberenders would try to see the end of this world by removing these dwarves from their etenal task. The dwarves are immortal and should one be slain he would probably resume his task of holding the Sky in its proper place.
