Lampades are nymphs of the Underworld and companions of the Mistress of Crossroads. They are joyful beings with a twisted sense of humor, that delight in dancing, revelry and hauntings. Their processions and dances light up the dark reaches of the Underworld and they bring brief moments of joy to the dreary dead. Their torches reveal the stygian paths and expose the shades of the Underworld. Lampades will never get lost when traveling on stygian paths and they can guide others through the Underworld.
