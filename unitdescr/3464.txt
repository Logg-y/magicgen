Afarit are powerful Jinnun born from Smokeless Flame. Endowed with exceptional physical and magical might they are arrogant and cruel, and might be perceived as outright evil. The Afarit and their Sultans rule the magical kingdom of Ubar and the lesser Jinnun. There are few Afarit and their warriors only join armies when called upon by their Sultans. When commanded by their Sultans a few Ifrit Warriors can obliterate entire armies by themselves. Afarit are spiritual beings and are invisible until they manifest. When wounded they reveal their true form, ablaze with Smokeless Flame, a pure green and yellow fire of incredible heat. Afarit are attuned to magic and are stronger in provinces where magic is strong. Afarit suffer from two weaknesses, iron and salt, and with the aid of these mankind might prevail.
