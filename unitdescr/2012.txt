Some Gittites have found the bloody cult of the Kohanim despicable and have sworn their life to aid the meek. They tend the human population of Gath and perform services in small tabernacles. They are considered heretic by the Kohanim, but since they rarely cause trouble they are allowed to tend their human flocks. They are sometimes forced to join the royal army of Gath to tend wounded soldiers. The Abba is skilled in nature magic and healing, but can use the magic of their ancestors as well.
