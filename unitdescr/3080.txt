The Duiu of Farming is a giant of divine heritage once given mandate over rural life by a previous Pantokrator. Crops, cattle and fertility were his to command. He taught mankind how to grow and harvest crops, make wine and brew beer, and care for cattle of all kinds. So great were his gifts to mankind that men lost faith in their true God, the Pantokrator. Furious the Pantokrator gave his servant wine and beer to drink, and the Duiu drank and fell asleep, a sleep from which he would never awake. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, his drunken stupor has lost its enchantment and the Duiu of Farming is slowly waking up. The Duiu of Farming wields a great hammer and carries a bowl that produces gems of nature.
