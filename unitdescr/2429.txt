Dis Mater is one of the Lion Queens who arrived from Machaka. She was once Chido, bride of Ega, a Lion King of legend. She was taught dark magic by an ancient Bouda and became a power to rival the Spider Clan Sorcerers. She was old by the time the exile Lion Queens fled from Mababwe. When the Lion Queens approached the Melqarts of Hinnom, she was among the first to succumb to the temptation of Blood magic. Through blood sacrifices the old crone has made herself eternally young. Some claim this is an act of simple vanity, others that it is an act of royal madness. She herself claims that it is to be ready when the Melqart king of the city arrives. She has used her skills in the dark arts of the Hyena to reanimate a retinue of skeletal servants in her palace. When first approached by Ermorian diplomats, they got the impression that she was the queen of the nation and were horrified by her ritual practices and undead servants. They gave her the derogatory title of Queen of the Underworld and the name of Dis Mater has stuck.
