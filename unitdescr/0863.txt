Panicratos is a young Pan with an unrivaled bad temper. His dismay at the fate of Pangaea turned him into a vengeful warrior. For a time, he stalked and slew human priests, but then the Dark Lord drew his attention. He has abandoned his magical practices and become a sacred warrior for the Angry God of Asphodel. Panicratos is not a great mage by the standards of the Panii, but he is a formidable warrior and an able assassin.
