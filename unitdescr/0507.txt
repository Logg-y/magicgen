Hildegard was the only child of the late Hochmeister of the Black Order. Her father taught her how to fight and wanted her to join the Order, but she was a strong-willed young woman who didn't like the strict hierarchical organization of the Order. She decided to become a freelance warrior and as such, she has become known and respected. During her more adventurous years, Hildegard befriended a black unicorn who still accompanies her.
