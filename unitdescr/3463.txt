Jinnun are spiritual beings born from Smokeless Flame in a distant past. They replaced the Hinn and Binn during the reign of a previous Pantokrator. They are naturally invisible and ethereal, but can take physical form when they interact with men. The Jinnun live in Ubar, a magic desert kingdom of marvelous riches. Once the City of Brass was the capital of the Jinnun, but the gates were sealed by a divine decree and the City was hidden from the eyes of men. All that was left was windswept pillars and a city covered in sand, known to man as Iram of a Thousand Pillars. Here the few remaining Jinnun and their human servants gather and wait for the seals to break. The City of Brass once fielded armies of Jinnun armed with enchanted weapons. These Jinn Warriors now follow the Jinn Emirs of Iram, waiting for the Gates of Brass to open and the war upon mankind restarted so that magic can be restored to the world. There are many Jinn races with different abilities and powers, but they are all born from Smokeless Flame and therefore strongly attuned to magic, ethereal and invisible unless they wish to be seen. Jinnun are vulnerable to iron and salt and the Jinn Warriors of Ubar use armaments of bronze.
