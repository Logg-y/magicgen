The Grey Ones, Graeae, are three crone sisters spawned by Phorkys, Father of Monsters, at the dawn of time. When the Pantokrator reformed the world he slew or banished all monsters that threatened the world. The Graeae, while not nearly as powerful as their father, were imprisoned and chained in a stygian cavern as a precaution. For millennia the crones have waited, getting older and angrier for every year that passed. Now with the Pantokrator gone, their shackles are weakening and their malice can be felt by those who dream. The Grey Ones are incredibly old and their bodies are frail and weak. Two of the sisters have lost their eyesight and now the three of them share a single eye. All three sisters use death and water magic, but they have all mastered different magical paths. The first of the Sisters, 'the Terrible', uses blood and nature magic. The second sister, known as 'the Warlike' uses fire and earth magic and the third sister, 'the Destroyer' uses air and astral magic.
