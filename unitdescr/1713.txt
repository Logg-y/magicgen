The Devala is a personification of music and a lesser god of the Celestial Sphere. The divine tunes of the Devalas once filled this world, but when the Devatas of Kailasa withdrew to the heavens, the Devalas followed and the world was made a duller place. The mere presence of a Devala will cause the Divine Music to once again permeate the world and increase the Magic scale of a province. She is a powerful mage-priest and is sacred.
