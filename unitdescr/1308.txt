The Hird is the personal guard of a Jarl. The hirdmen are chosen from the best warriors of the land and they are the elites of Jotunheim. Given the best arms and armors available they can stand up to almost any foe. Hirdmen are entrusted with the life of their Jarl and they serve as vigilant and loyal bodyguards. The giants of Jotunheim are stronger and tougher than most giants and their ancestry make them almost impervious to cold. Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning bolts.
