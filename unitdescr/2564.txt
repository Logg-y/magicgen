There are three clans of Caelians. The Caelians of Spire Horn Mountain trace their lineage from the Kavi heroes of old. The Kavi were blessed by the Mainyus of the sky and their descendants are more closely attuned to the wind and the storms than the other Caelians. Militia are quickly levied troops with light armaments. They are rarely used in military campaigns and are not skilled enough fliers to be able to fly during storms.
