A carrion centaur is the reanimated carcass of a centaur Hierophant. The soul of the centaur is forced to rejoin its own moss-covered carcass by a Panic Apostate. The bones are entwined with vines and roots that have a life of their own. The priestly powers of the former centaur are corrupted. Instead, the carrion centaur has unholy powers over the dead and is able to create manikins by animating vines, roots and the bones of dead beasts.
