The temples of Caelum are guarded by fanatical soldiers who have given up the ability to fly. By cutting off their wings, they lose the freedom so highly valued in Caelian society and commit themselves to serving their God and Master. The loss of wings grants them greater agility on the ground and lets them fight in dense formations. The Temple Guards don the traditional armor of the Iceclads that magically temper with colder climate. Their ice blades are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
