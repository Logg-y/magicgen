The satyr is a being of the wild with the horns and hindquarters of a goat. It is a creature of uninhibited, hedonistic passions and is attracted to the feasts and orgies of the Cult of Revelry where it can dance and fornicate for nights on end. The satyr can seduce women with the lure of the wild and turn them into raging maenads.
