Pelagia was founded by pure-blooded Tritons of the Pearl and Coral Clans. The Coral Clan is the martial clan and the hoplites of the clan are the elites of the kingdom. Once the soldiers of the Coral Clan used coral armor, but now with the knowledge of bronze working they don heavy bronze hauberks and wield long spears, much like the hoplites of Arcoscephale.
