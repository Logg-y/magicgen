When the Jade Amazons arrived in Sauromatia, they were led by sorceresses and priestesses. The warlike Sauromatian society had little use for magical leadership. To remain in power, the Amazon royalty changed their ways and turned to war. The young maidens selected to become sorceresses must also pass rigorous martial and priestly training. Those who fail the martial training die. Those who fail the magical training become Oiorpata, Manflayers or sacred warriors mounted on lizards, a legacy from their Amazon past. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The number of tattoos represent standing in society and more prominent warriors are covered in dark etchings.
