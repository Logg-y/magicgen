A Lich Queen is the dried husk of an ancient queen adept in Death magic. Through dark rituals, she succeeded in mastering one of mankind's oldest and most urgent goals, to defeat death. By removing her viscera and hiding it outside her body, she is virtually impossible to slay. Should the body be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of dead humans. Being immortal, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood. The Lich Queen lacks the Arch Mage's broad base of magical knowledge, but her reanimated body is more durable than a living body since it is leathery and dry and lacks all organs of importance.
