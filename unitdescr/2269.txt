In the center of the First City lies an enormous temple ground. The Entu is a priestess-queen and consort of the Ensi. She is the highest ranking priestess of the sacred kingdom. Her most important role is as a vessel for the divine principle of fertility. In the yearly ritual of the sacred marriage she is impregnated by the Ensi as the rain impregnates the earth. Together the sacred couple ensures the fertility and prosperity of Ur.
