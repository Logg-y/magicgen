Caractor was the highest ranking Censor at the time of Ermor's fall. As Arch Censor, he was responsible for keeping a sharp lookout for corruption among the mages and priests. As punishment for failing this task, the curse struck him harder than his servants. Horrible pain now distorts his dried face and his dead eyes burn with hatred for the living. His physical strength is tremendous and his leathery body is as tough as wood.
