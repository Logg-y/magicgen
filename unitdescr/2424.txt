Magic in Berytos has always been heavily influenced by the Telkhine legacy. Berytian sages try to unearth and recover Telkhine lore lost in ancient times. While the Storm Callers have great power at their disposal, the sages are numerous and adept researchers. They bring their discoveries to the lords of the kingdom for use in warfare as well as in the building of the empire.
