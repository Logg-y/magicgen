Phlegyas, the Theurg Tyrant, was born and educated in Pythium as a Theurg and master of the Theurg Communion. Overly ambitious he found himself caught up in political games. He soon made himself powerful enemies in the church and found himself outmaneuvered by the masters of the game. He was accused of sacrilege and was exiled from Pythium. For the time he put his political aspirations aside and left for Phlegra to study ancient lore. Having skills beyond most Trophimoi he was well received by the Tyrants. However, he soon discovered that the Gigantes were unfit to rule the human population and he took it upon himself to dominate and coerce the humans into docile servitude. Having mastered the arcane techniques used by the Theurgs of Pythium he offered the Tyrants his knowledge in return for power over his fellow men. Together with the Elder Cyclopses he forged the arcane shackles used to dominate magically trained individuals. For a time he became master of an arcane communion to rival that of Pythium, but the Tyrants recognized the power of communal arcana and coerced Phlegyas to work with the Cyclopses and forge master headbands, so that more Trophimoi could lead the communion. Phlegyas still serves the Tyrants as the most influential of the Oppressors, but he resents the fact that he no longer is the sole master of the shackled mages. He has since vied for new avenues of power and has started to reform the divided church of Phlegra. As a former Theurg he has become the single most influential priest in the kingdom.
