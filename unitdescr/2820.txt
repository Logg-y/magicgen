It is possible that the shamans of the Bone Tribes once encountered the Enkidus of the swamps of Ur and learned their ways from the wild men. They call themselves Bone Readers and their magic is similar in many ways. The Bone Readers make bone charms for the warriors of the tribe and prepare the cannibalistic feast held after a victorious battle.
