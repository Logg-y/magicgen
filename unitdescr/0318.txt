Recently deceased bodies unnaturally animated into a state of false life, the soulless are often dressed in the clothes they died in. Soulless do not have any vital organs, but their bodies are in a state of decomposition, so they are easier to destroy than a wight or a lich. Soulless are often called zombies. They do not rout unless their master is killed. The soulless are mindless and will quickly dissolve if left without leadership on the battlefield.
