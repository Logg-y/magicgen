The first Abysians sprung from the Fires of Rhuax were large magmatic beings, barely resembling humans at all. Slowly these monstrosities developed into humanoids. With every generation, the Fires of Rhuax grew cooler in their bodies and the flaming Children of Rhuax became smoldering Abysians. The Burning One is an Abysian of prominent heritage, claiming succession from the Children of Rhuax. The Burning Ones are surrounded by flames and most of them are trained as priests or sacred warriors.
