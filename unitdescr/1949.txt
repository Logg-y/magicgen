The Leshiy is a guardian of forests. In the heart of its forest it takes the appearance of a huge man with grayish-green skin, covered in lichen, grass and vines. A single horn grows from his forehead and his feet are hoofed. If he leaves his forest he will shrink and become smaller and smaller and lose much of his magical powers. While inside a forest, the Leshiy is able to shapeshift into a great bear covered in moss and lichen.
