A divine being summoned to this world to teach men to trust in themselves and the steel they wield. Armed with formidable gear, Iron Angels silently state the strength of superior skill and true craftsmanship. The Iron Angel teaches men not to trust in either magic or faith and demonstrates the weakness of blind faith by stopping sacred beings in their tracks. Fanatical adherents of other faiths will find themselves awed, belittled and unable to strike the angel. The Iron Angel never uses magic and his fist will strike magical beings with utmost judgment.
