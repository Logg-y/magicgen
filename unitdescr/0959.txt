Percival the Pocket Knight is, as his name implies, a Pocket Knight. He was made by an unknown craftsman long ago and has since showed up in various battles through the ages. Percival looks much like any knight, except that he is made out of tin. He also behaves much like an ordinary knight, except that he lives in a pocket. When the horns of battle sound, Percival will charge out of his bearer's pocket, land on the ground, grow to full size and deliver fierce battle to the enemy. Percival's main diet is lint and the occasional shot of tin polish.
