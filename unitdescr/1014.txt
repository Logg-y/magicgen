The halberdiers of Ulm are armed with heavy halberds. The secrets of Blacksteel have been forgotten since the Malediction, but normal plate cuirasses are still used. Halberdiers count as two normal soldiers when defending besieged castles. The inhabitants of Ulm are large and can endure much physical punishment before collapsing, but are vulnerable to magic.
