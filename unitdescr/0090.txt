With the weakening of the Flame, there are no more Burning Ones born and Lava Warriors have replaced them as sacred warriors. Lava Warriors are the elite of the Abysian war machine. They are driven by an anger that turns into blind, berserk rage when they are wounded. These elite warriors train in the lava pits of the Smouldercone and are able to draw strength from the heat. They are very powerful in warm provinces, but cold will break down their great strength. Lava Warriors are armed with twin morning stars and serve the Anathemants without fear.
