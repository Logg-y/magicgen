During the war against Ermor death and disease devastated the lands of Marignon. Only when the war was over did doctors discover means to prevent and cure sickness and disease. The lessons learned during the war against Ermor has now been put to use and an increasing number of Plague Doctors ply their trade in the kingdom. While their skills are appreciated they are also feared as their presence often heralds an outbreak of pox or plague. The Plague Doctors are skilled in curing diseases, but in the War to End All Wars, they have put their skills to a more sinister use. Enemies of Marignon have found their realms suffering from the very plague that once ravaged the kingdom. Plague Doctors wear dark waxed cloaks and masks that prevent miasmatic air from affecting them.
