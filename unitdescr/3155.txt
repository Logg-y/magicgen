While the Colossi men of Phaeacia often become skilled traders and sailors, the women are accomplished craftsmen and cunning workers at the loom. They weave silk and linen into the fabled garments of Phaeacia, but they also weave the sails used by the Dark Vessels and other marvelous items. It is said that the Weavers can weave moonbeams and even fate itself.
