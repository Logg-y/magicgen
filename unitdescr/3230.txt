Polybotes was once the King of the proud race of Gigantes, who declared war upon the gods of men. When his kin were defeated he was punished for his hubris and was cursed, deformed and trapped beneath a mountain. From time to time his furious rage has unleashed eruptions of molten rock and lava. Now, he has finally broken free and the volcano beneath which he was imprisoned is sundered and gone. Polybotes is once more free to wreak havoc on men and Gods.
