Mermen are amphibious beings related to Tritons, but have fish tails instead of legs. Mermen have strange powers of transformation and can remove their tails to walk on dry land. Some mermen build coastal villages. They are used to fighting on dry land. They are called Turtle Warriors by their brethren and are often used in raids on inland provinces.
