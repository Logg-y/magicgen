An Ether Lord is an ancient mage and clan leader of the Ether Warriors. It was the Ether Lords who had drained the world of Arcana and led their clans into their otherworldly realm to continue their clan wars. Ether Lords are ethereal and very difficult to harm with non-magical weapons. Ether Lords use Moon Lances, magical spears that cause additional damage to magical beings. Ether Lords are powerful wielders of Astral magic as well as Death magic.
