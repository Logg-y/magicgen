When the first drops of water made the earth hollow, the Roots of the Earth formed into a womb of stone and black water. The primordial water of Apsu caressed the under-earth and a giant woman formed in the Womb of the Earth. Given life and purpose by the Pantokrator, she was charged with caring for the under-earth. But she fell in love with the subterranean lifeforms and was seduced by the eldest Olm and gave birth to strange amphibian humanoids with external gills and cyclops eyes. At first the Pantokrator tolerated her misstep, and she helped him form the Seal that must not be Broken. But the making of the Seal demanded a huge sacrifice of her progeny, and she demanded compensation for her kin. Angry with her impudence he imprisoned her for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone her prison is weakening, but so is the Seal.
