The Hooded Spirits is an entity consisting of three spirits of fertility and growth. It was given the divine spark by a goddess of a sacred spring and served her faithfully until the previous Pantokrator rose to power. When the Pantokrator banished all gods the Hooded Spirits were spared and given the task of bringing fertility and prosperity to all mankind. But the spirits were seduced by men and sired offspring with divine sparks. The Pantokrator was furious and banished his servants for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the hooded spirits are once more able to enter the world and bring fertility to the land. When together the spirits are very powerful, but if they separate they lose much of their magical power. The Hooded Spirits are able to unify at any time which will bring the spirits together no matter how far apart they are.
