The Triton noble families are allowed to rule the lands once theirs as administrators and military leaders. They follow old traditions and train hippocampoi steeds once used by the sacred Knights of the Deeps. But Tritons are no longer priests, nor are they trained as holy warriors of the new faith. Now they are but soldiers and generals expected to lead the Triton armies in conquest for the King of Both Worlds.
