When the Vaettir formed their Jarldom they were aided and influenced by the Gygjas and Vaettiheim is in many ways modeled on the Jarldom of Jotunheim. The Vaetti Jarls are independent chieftains who work together under the guidance of the Gygjas. But the Vaetti Jarls are not religious leaders as the Jarls of Jotunheim were. Instead Godar and Gygjor perform ceremonies and lead the Rimvaettir to spread the chill of winter. The Vaetti Jarls are by most standards mediocre commanders and the Jarldom has yet to produce able generals.
