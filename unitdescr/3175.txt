Geryon is a three-headed Gigante descendant from the phaeacian Gigantes of Black Korkyra. Long ago he settled in the land of the setting sun and was tasked with guarding the red cattle of the underworld. He was given Orthrus, the Hound of Twilight to guard his herd. When the mermen of Erytheia arrived in his lands he allowed them to remain as long as they did not disturb his red cattle. Geryon has befriended a cyclops herdsman that now herd his wondrous cattle.
