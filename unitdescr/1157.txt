Fatherless children are treated harshly in Ulm. They are kept as slaves and brought to the Wheel of Pain where they are forced to do heavy labor while exposed to the elements. Those few who survive are adopted by the shamans and given training by spirits of ancient swordsmen summoned by the shamans. Steel Warriors are sacred and fight with great two-handed swords.
