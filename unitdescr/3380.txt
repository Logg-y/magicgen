Coradin is the Protopope, the Prime Primate and only second to the Arch Pope in religious authority. He guides the Viceroy Primates in matters of state as well as faith. The Protopope is a temporal as much as a religious leader and his advice on statecraft is invaluable. When not visiting distant provinces he sits at the left side of the Prester King at his Emerald Table in the Sublime Palace. Coradin once stumbled and fell when he was to drink from the Fountain of Youth and he was totally immersed in its healing waters. He has never again attracted any disease and poisons are as spices to his palate.
