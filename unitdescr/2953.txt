With the transfer of religious power from the First City to the City of Gods, the sacred warriors and priests of old lost their influence. Fewer and fewer of Enki's Chosen were trained in the House of Water. The end of the old order came when the Entu of the Moon founded a new military order in honor of the Moon. Since the priesthood of the Moon was a predominantly female institution, so too would the new order be. Partly as a political move to avoid dependence on the Ensis and the wealthy, the Order of the Moon is comprised entirely of orphan girls and infants given to the temple by mothers unable to care for their daughters. Trained from an early age, they are taught to rely on each other and are drilled to fight with unwavering loyalty in close formations. The Maidens of the Moon are traditionally equipped with bronze for religious reasons.
