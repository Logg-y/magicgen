The last of the Elder Cyclopes have vanished from Phlegra as they were slain, eaten or exiled by the Phlegran Tyrants. But a few of their descendants survived, shackled in the dungeons underneath Telepylos, forging artifacts for their absent masters. During the human rebellion in Telepylos the Cyclope Smiths were released by the last Tyrant to fight against the humans. With the aid of their lesser kin the Cyclope Smiths successfully crushed the rebellion. They were rewarded and granted privilege and influence over the human population. But the Cyclope Smiths were almost as uncaring of statecraft as the Tyrants themselves, and turned their focus to their arts. Instead of herding the human population they armed their lesser kin with superior weapons and armors to ensure that the Cyclopes would remain in power as warriors of unequalled strength.
