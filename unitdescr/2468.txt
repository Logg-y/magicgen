The Druids are philosophers, mages and priests. They serve as high priests and are present at every major religious ceremony in the realm. The Druidic lore includes astrology and Earth magic. Some Druids have backgrounds as Gutuaters and have some skills in Nature magic as well. The Druids come from all tribes, although a disproportionate number are Sequani by birth. All Druids can perform blood sacrifices.
