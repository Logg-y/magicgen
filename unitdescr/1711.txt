Good standing with one's ancestral spirits is of utmost importance in T'ien Ch'i. Once Masters of the Dead divined the will of the ancestral spirits, but during the heyday of the Empire, their influence dwindled as the official cult of the Bureaucracy spread. During the reign of the Barbarian Kings, ancestor worship has been reintroduced. Ancestor Guides are wise men, sages and diviners of barbarian heritage concerned with the well being of the ancestral spirits and their relations with the living. Only the old and dying are able to influence the dead and thus Ancestor Guides are invariably old.
