The Rephaim of the Amorite tribe are known for their malice and cunning. Many of them practice the dark arts and most of the Emim and Zamzummim come from this tribe. Amorite warriors often tip their spears with poison. They rely on their shields and spears to keep enemies at bay long enough for the poison to work. They are considered cowardly by some.
