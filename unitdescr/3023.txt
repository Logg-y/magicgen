The bronze-clad hoplites of Erytheia are trained and equipped in the fashion of the old Pelagian mermen hoplites. Their main role is to be a heavy and flexible contingent able to strike from land into the sea, or from the sea into coastal regions. Since they are weaker than the Triton hoplites in underwater battles, and not as efficient as the phalangites on dry land, they are seen as redundant by some military leaders.
