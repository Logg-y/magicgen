Ancient trees are sometimes inhabited by spirits that can manifest themselves as beautiful women. These spirits are stunningly beautiful and few mortals would willingly harm them. Woodland Spirits are ethereal and regenerate wounds as long as their tree is not destroyed. They never willingly leave the province they are summoned to and will waste away and die if forced apart from their forest.
