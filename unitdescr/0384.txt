The Neter is a giant of divine heritage. Given skills and powers of creation by a previous Pantokrator, he became the master crafter and chief architect of creation. With the creation of the world complete, his services were no longer needed and he was banished for eternity. Having created eternity, the Neter was not too concerned and waited for the Pantokrator to disappear. Now he has returned to claim the world he created.
