The Teotl is a giant of divine heritage. With the deception of the Teteo Inan and her plot against the Pantokrator, the Pantokrator answered by impregnating the Mother of Gods with a ball of feathers. When she gave birth, the Teotl was born fully aware and armed with a serpent stolen from his mother's womb. He was given power and rage by the Pantokrator and promptly slew his older siblings. With the rebellion quelled, the Pantokrator placed him in charge of the Armies of the Western Sun. He became the Warrior Supreme who crushed and devoured the enemies of the world in the name of his master. When the Pantokrator claimed the world and rewrote the Tablets of Destiny, he no longer needed the Warrior Supreme. Imprisoned for eternity, the Teotl raged against his prison, but not until the Pantokrator disappeared and his divine decree ended could he break loose. Now the Teotl of War has come to claim a world rightfully his. The Teotl is war-painted and wears a black war-mask over his face. He is armed with the Serpent he was born with and uses it as an enchanted club that will poison his enemies with its venomous fangs.
