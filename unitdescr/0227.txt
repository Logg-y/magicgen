Satyrs are wild men with the hindquarters and horns of a goat. They are powerfully built and can easily outrun the swiftest of humans. Satyrs are selfish beings who lack discipline and will quickly flee from battle if the odds are against them. Their strong connection with Nature gives satyrs strong resistance to magic. These lighter satyr infantry troops use shields and spears and sometimes carry javelins. Satyr sneaks are especially good at stealth, but do not use shields. They are sometimes found in groves and forest thickets deep inside enemy lands seducing farmers' daughters and wives. Satyr sneaks cause unrest in the province where they dwell.
