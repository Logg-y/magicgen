Born at the dawn of time the Thrice Horned Boar represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. As a creature of unbridled fury and a manifestation of rage and fertility it was worshiped by the first of men as a god of war and the hunt. Thrice blessed by the previous Pantokrator it became his herald, warrior and general when he brought order to the world. When the work of the Pantokrator was finished he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Golden Boar was deemed too unruly to remain in Creation. The Crested Boar was forever imprisoned in the forest of the Horned One where he found an ally with a temperament resembling his own. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Thrice Horned Boar of War is breaking free to lead his followers in peace and war. A crest of bristles, golden skin and three horns on the forehead sets the Thrice Horned Boar apart as a divine being with powers far surpassing the monstrous boars that sometimes appear in the lands of men.
