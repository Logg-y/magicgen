More than a generation ago a new power emerged in the Phoenix Empire. Refugees from a distant kingdom arrived with claims of divine heritage. Machakan sorceresses of the royal family and their Colossi guards came to the grand temple of Berytos and claimed to be Brides-in-Waiting, ready to wed the absent gods upon their eventual arrival. They managed to wrest the leadership of the Melqart-cult from a divided priesthood and impressed the populace with their sorcerous and physical might. As brides of the Melqarts, the sorceresses could reign with divine legitimacy. But the sorceresses had not expected the Melqarts to act. Tempted by the brides, as their Grigori ancestors once were tempted by the Avvim, their will soon manifested itself and the brides found themselves drawn to blood sacrifice and perverse rites. Now the Brides-in-Waiting lead the bloody cult of the Melqarts from the great temple in Berytos, ready to be impregnated by their masters upon their promised arrival.
