A general of the Underworld reawakened to serve a necromancer, the Bane is armed with a Bane Blade that will cause wounds to fester and flesh to shrivel. Banes are so closely connected with the Netherworld that they are surrounded by a wind of numbing cold. Banes are corporeal undead with leathery bodies that can withstand much damage.
