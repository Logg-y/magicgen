The inhabitants of the wilderness of Ulm are strong and proud. They are as resilient as the mountains and as strong as oaks. They live off the land and are skilled woodsmen and mountaineers. Upon coming of age, every man makes his choice of weapon. Those who choose the sword are trained in two-weapon fighting, stealth and wilderness survival. They are used to fight in loose formations.
