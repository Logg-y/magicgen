While many Enkidus live in or near the cities there is still a large population of Enkidus with a tribal ancestry. They do not live in the cities, but are often economically dependent on trade with the city states. From time to time these tribal Enkidus have been the source of unrest, but with the coming of the Awakening God they have joined forces with the Ensis of the city states.
