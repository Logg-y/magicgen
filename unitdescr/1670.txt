Yukinaga is a Dai Bakemono of remarkable talent. He began his career as a bodyguard of Yamafumi the Eternal, an ancient and powerful Bakemono sorcerer. He accompanied the sorcerer at all times. Yukinaga stood watch as Bakemono from near and far came to the sorcerer searching for advice. With time, the ancient sorcerer came to trust the bodyguard and Yukinaga was greatly rewarded. At first he was given magical training, but with time greater gifts were revealed to him. The sorcerer accidentally gave Yukinaga the greatest gift of all, eternal life. The ancient Yamafumi had discovered the means to hide his heart and his mortality. This knowledge he unwittingly revealed to Yukinaga, who found and pierced his master's heart. Yukinaga hid his own mortality, slew seven Bakemono generals and claimed lordship over their tribes. He is now the most feared Bakemono general in the realm, skilled in battle and magic and immortal.
