The Knights of the Stone are a knightly brotherhood of heroic champions. Only thirteen members are allowed and only when one of their number dies will another Valiant Champion replace him. The Knights sometimes aid the Witches of Avalon. The Knights are exceptional leaders and unequaled in battle prowess.
