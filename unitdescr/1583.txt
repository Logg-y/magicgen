Athalwolf is an ancient shaman who has trained more Steel Warriors than any other shaman. After his favorite disciple, Hrodric, died protecting Athalwolf's granddaughter from an Ermorian Senator, he sequestered himself in a damp cave for over a dozen years with ghosts as his only company. Only when he was approached by Warenheris, the son of his granddaughter and Hrodric, did he leave his seclusion. Athalwolf summoned seven ancestors, including Hrodric, Warenheris' father, to give his great-grandson unparalleled battle training. Now the two of them have parted ways, but Athalwolf is once again training Steel Warriors with the aid of the ancestors.
