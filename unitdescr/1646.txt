When a young student is accepted into the Magisters' Halls he may choose the direction of his studies. Only a few have the inner strength to become masters of magic. Many a Magister began his studies in the magic arts, but decided that the cost was too high or his skills too limited. Those who do have true magical aptitude sequester themselves in the Seven High Towers and delve into the magical mysteries for many years. When a student has mastered the Arcane Exams, he emerges as a Magister Arcane, skilled in the magics of Air and Earth. The Magisters of Chelms have developed magical techniques that allow them to work under the Curse and they are unaffected by a Drain dominion.
