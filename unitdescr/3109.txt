The Gigantes of Mekone consider themselves superior to all and have used their might to enslave lesser men. Mekone is a martial society, where combat prowess and strength are the primary virtues. Trade and lesser crafts are condemned as unworthy to the Gigantes and human slaves and servants make up most of the menial work force. The Gigantes are trained from a young age to become formidable warriors armed with gleaming weapons forged by the Elder Cyclopes. The Ekdromoi are lightly armed hoplites trained to move with speed and leave and enter formations when needed. They often serve as flank guards to the hoplite phalanx.
