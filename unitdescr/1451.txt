There have never been any horses living in the caverns of Agartha, but there are other cave-dwelling beings that have come to substitute them. Cave drake nests are plundered and the eggs hatched and trained as mounts or beasts of burden. Highborn warriors who can afford them train them for battle. The cave drakes are slow and the benefit of riding one is limited to the extra defence and the mighty bite of the beast. However, if the rider is killed, the beast fights on and cave drakes can be very stubborn and difficult to slay.
