Li T'ieh-Kuai is one of the Immortals, the ancient heroes of T'ien Ch'i who have attained a limited form of divinity. Li T'ieh-Kuai lived as a hermit and explored the Celestial Spheres by astral travel. One day, his travels carried him farther than normal and when he returned, he found his body cremated. He was forced to enter the body of a freshly dead, crippled old man. He now wanders the land, cursing and pestering good folks. His ugly face, crippled body and rude demeanor are frightening, to say the least. As if this wasn't frightening enough, his mere presence causes leprosy in those nearby.
