Vaetti Hags are self-taught Seithkonur of Vaetti stock. While most Vaetti seeresses study under the Jotun Gygjas there are some who live reclusive lives in the forests of Vaettiheim and practice their arts in secret. With the imminent Awakening of the Lord, steps has been taken to gather the hags and give them a part in the bright future of Vaettiheim. The Vaetti Hags are not very good at magical research, but they often put up simple yet efficient magical laboratories in their woodland homes.
