Serpent Acolytes are lowly priests of the Pythian Serpent Cult. Upon joining the Temple, they receive a new name. They do not wear the distinctive masks of the Serpent Priests. Upon inauguration into the Priesthood, the Acolytes must prove their resistance to the venom of snakes. Only then is the Acolyte deemed worthy and given the mask and staff. Just like any Serpent Priest the acolytes are able to train Hydra Hatchlings in any temple that has access to a swamp.
