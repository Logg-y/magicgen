While mankind toil and serve, the Cyclopes wage war upon inferior races. However, the Cyclopes are few in numbers and much of the Phlegran armies are still composed of human slaves armed and coerced into military service by human taskmasters. Since humans cannot compete with the strength of the cyclopes there are no qualms about giving them good arms. Phlegran slave soldiers have equipment matching most of the soldiers of this age. Skilled Helote Soldiers can receive the dubious honor of promotion. Given heavy armor and an enchanted Iron Band the slave soldier's loyalty is ensured. Called Iron Bound, these soldiers are known never to rout from battle.
