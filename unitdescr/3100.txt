The Perioecis are subjugated settlements that are given limited self-governance. The Perioeci are free, unlike the helotes, but have limited status and influence. Since the Gigantes are forbidden to engage in ignoble activities, such as trade, the Perioeci have found themselves increasingly important to Mekone. They have even been allowed to join the Mekonean armies. The Perioeci are not the property of the state and can rarely afford heavy armor. Thus most Perioeci are trained as lightly armed peltasts or serve as scouts of the Mekonean armies.
