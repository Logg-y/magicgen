After the fall of the Raptor clan the Spire Horn Caelians have become the martial clan of the magocracy. Skilled Spire Horn Warriors are rewarded with status as Storm Guards. Their ancestry and special training has given them the ability to fly even during heavy storms. They are considered pure and are allowed to use ice cuirasses and ice aegii. Their training and armor give them increased resistance to cold and lightning compared to regular Spire Horn Warriors. The protection gained from the ice armor depends on the temperature of the province. Their ice lances are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
