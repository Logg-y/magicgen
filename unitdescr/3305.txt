In Magnificent Ind there is a land of little horned men who serve the Prester King. While ugly and menacing-looking they are righteous and loyal and vigilantly follow their king to defend their land from the strange birds that attack every year. The Piconye Soldiers are the elites of the kingdom and fight with shortswords instead of spears.
