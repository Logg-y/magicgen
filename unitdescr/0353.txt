Sorceresses and priestesses are the rulers of Amazonian society. They perform ceremonies and blessings and train the sacred troops of the tribe. Jade Amazons are more skilled in magic than the other tribes. Their priestesses use Water and Nature magic and their sorceresses complement Water and Nature magic with other magic paths.
