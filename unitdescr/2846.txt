The humans of Therodos were struck hardest by the cataclysm. Those who survived the initial blast drowned when the land sunk underneath the waves. Once dead their shattered souls were barred from entering the underworld and their ghosts remained in the sunken lands they once inhabited, unaware of their undead state of existence. In the blessed lands of the Telkhines there was little hardship for the privileged and some humans were able to spend their days thinking and debating with each other. The ghosts of these men still linger and their voices can be heard in the shattered agoras of ancient Therodos. Their conclusions on the subject of magic will contribute to the research of the nation.
