The Se'irim are goat-demons of the desert begotten by Azazel, Bringer and Taker of Civilization. After breaking his celestial vows, the angel sinned against man and beast. As children of Azazel, the Se'irim are sacred to Avvim. The Horim have encountered them in the desert and mistakenly worship them as lords of the wild.
