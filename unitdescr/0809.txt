Shadow Vestals are the result of a dark rite known as Shadow Merging. Young girls are trained in the Temple of the Dead to prepare them for the merging. When ready, a girl surrenders herself and is buried alive in the Campus Sceleris, the Field of Wickedness. When her heart stops her body and soul is merged with the ghost of an ancient Vestal Virgin and her life is spared. Her body is exhumed and she is given a new name and a new life. The Shadow Vestal is an ethereal being, part living and part dead. Shadow Vestals are sacred and can be blessed.
