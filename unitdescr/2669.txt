Zotz, the bat people of Xibalba, breed quickly and have lifespans far surpassing humans. In deep caves and dark forests they multiply and form swarming colonies. The Zotz use swarm tactics to overwhelm their enemies, and rarely consider their own losses. The Zotz are sensitive to cold and go into torpor if exposed to cold climates. Since they are almost blind and their perceptions are short-ranged they are not very efficient at patrolling. The Zotz of Xibalba use light obsidian tipped lances or obsidian club swords.
