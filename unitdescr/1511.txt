Sölvis was born a Dis in the dark realm of Helheim. During the wars with Vanheim, she was wounded and captured by a young hero. During her captivity she fell in love with her captor and they decided to leave the wartorn lands. But then came the Valkyries of Helheim, led by her mother, Sigrdriva the Dis. From the dark skies they descended upon the small fortress where Sölvis' lover lived and slew every man and woman inside. In furious rage Sölvis swore to find her lover's murderers and has since aided Vanheim in the wars with Helheim. Sölvis is a Dis and has the power of flight. She has abandoned the dark ways of her former sisters and has learned the magic of the sky and the sun. Her fury has granted her an aura of Divine Splendor.
