The Magister is an academic skilled in all things of learning. Trained as engineers, inventors, spies and mages, the Magisters are invaluable to the leaders of Man in peace and in war. The Magisters of Chelms have developed magical techniques that allow them to work under the Curse and they are unaffected by a Drain dominion.
