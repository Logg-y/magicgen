The King of Elemental Earth is a physical manifestation of the wild powers of the Earth. Pedoseion was the one closest to the people of the world. His Dominion was the soil and all that was growing. When veneration for the ancient spirit faded, he withdrew until he was reawakened by sacrificial blood. Horribly tainted by the blood, he lost some of his mind and his connection with the Earth and the soil gained knowledge of his power and shared his cravings for blood. Only three Kings of Elemental Earth are known to exist.
