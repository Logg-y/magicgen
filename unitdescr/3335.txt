The ‘Adites are a tribe of Avvite giants that originate from the lands of Hinnom. To avoid the oppression of the Rephaites they fled into the deserts of ‘Ad where they encountered the last of the Jinnun and formed an alliance. When the power of Ubar waned the ‘Adites became more influential and now the human Nabaeans serve the ‘Adites as they once served the Jinnun of Ubar. The ‘Adites are far superior to human troops and form the elite corps of the Nabaean army. They fight in the style once taught by the Rephaite descendants of Azazel.
