Since the spread of the mystery cults and the acceptance of the Serpent Cult, the Theurgs have lost most of their former influence. Once spokesmen of the Faith and magicians of the Spheres, Theurgs are now but another cult of the Emerald Empire. The great Cathedral of the Spheres is now little more than a temple and school for arcane mystics. Out of respect for tradition, the Theurgs are still allowed some religious influence.
