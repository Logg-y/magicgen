When the first Machakans arrived at Great Mababwe, the rulers of the city made themselves kings over the new people. The other inhabitants of the city were not allowed to advance to royalty, but they were still considered semi-divine by the Machakans. Some of the Colossi continued to live in comfort, but some found themselves worshipped as sacred warriors of unequaled strength. Armed with ancient weapons and pelts from Kithaironic Lions they marched with the armies of Machaka and conquered every tribe, city and kingdom they came across. Every Lion Warrior wears a Kithaironic Lion pelt and wields a sacred spirit club. When a warrior dies, his arms are returned to his family and his sons enter a ritual battle to determine who shall inherit his father's place as a sacred warrior. To make sure there is a worthy candidate, each warrior is supposed to beget as many sons as possible. Since most sons die in the battle there is a surplus of female Colossi and most warriors marry at least a dozen wives.
