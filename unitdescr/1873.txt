Throughout the Empire, mystery cults have spread and flourished with the influx of foreign culture. One of these, the Serpent Cult, has replaced the official state cult of the Theurgs, but many others ply their trade in secret. The Cult of the Solar Bull is very popular among the soldiers of the Limes and most of its higher members are former soldiers or Centurions. The Heliodromus, Sun-Courier, is the highest ranking member of the Cult of the Solar Bull. He, for it is only males that are allowed in the Cult, performs the Taurobolium, ritual sacrifice of a bull. The Heliodromus carries a golden sacrificial knife. Like all mystics of the Empire, the Heliodromus leads worshippers astray and lowers the Dominion in which he resides. He wears an exotic hat, reputedly similar to those of the foreign founders of the Cult. The Heliodromus forswears his former life upon initiation and does not lead armies. The Heliodromii are secretive and do not share their wisdom with outsiders. This makes them rather poor researchers.
