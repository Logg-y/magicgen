Elementals are projections of raw elemental power given life through strong magic. All elementals shrink in size and power when severely damaged. There are four kinds of elementals. Fire elementals are ethereal and difficult to harm. They radiate heat and cause severe damage to anyone they attack. Anyone striking at the elemental will take fire damage.
