Lion is the strongest and most influential of the totemic spirits. His followers serve as parish priests and diviners of Lion's will. At times they also lead armies. Lion is a king among animals and the Voices of Lion can call upon their master's authority when they lead animals and beasts. The Voices of Lion often bring specially trained War Lions into battle.
