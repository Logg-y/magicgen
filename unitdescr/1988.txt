The Yeddeoni is a Gittite necromancer descended from the Zamzummim of earlier times. Their skills and powers have diminished over the ages and the banquets for the dead are long since abandoned. When they lost cultic importance, they lost much of their influence and now they have become a mistrusted group of secretive sorcerers.
