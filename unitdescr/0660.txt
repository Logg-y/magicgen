Auluudh is a member of an ancient race sprung from the depths of the ocean. Aboleths once ruled the deep, but the falling star crushed their empire and allowed their slaves to free themselves and build kingdoms of their own. Now the Aboleths are returning to power and Auluudh will lead the way. He has decided that the minds of the Illithids are to his taste and has deemed them useful as food for the small Aboleth population and as slavemasters over the weaker races. Auluudh is very powerful and he can enslave weaker beings by the force of mind alone. He is also a powerful mage.
