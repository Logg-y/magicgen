Serpent Dancers are cultic dancers of the Great Temple of C'tis. They intoxicate themselves with serpent venom and perform whirling ritual dances. During these dances, they may strike someone in the audience with their poisonous staffs. Should the target survive the poisoning, it is considered a most fortunate event and his hatchlings would be accepted as acolytes in the Temple. Sometimes the Serpent Dancers are called upon to join the armies of C'tis as sacred warriors. They wield magical snake staffs, but they never don armor as it would hamper their ritual adulations. The snake staffs are magical and capable of hurting ethereal beings. Serpent Dancers are resistant to most forms of poison.
