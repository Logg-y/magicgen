The tribe of Zebulun is a rich and prosperous tribe. Their wealth has enabled them to field soldiers of outstanding skill. They fight with spear and shield and ever since a vast army from Arcoscephale passed through their homelands, they have adopted the dense formations of the hoplites. Their traditional color is silvery white.
