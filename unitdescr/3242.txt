Perkuna Tete was conceived and born under an Oak during a severe thunderstorm. Thunder and Oak blessed her and she was raised under the tutelage of the Perkunu thunder priests. Perkuna Tete does not share the rage of the Bear with her Perkunu tutors. She is not blessed by the Bear and can not take bear shape in battles. Instead she is blessed with the calm fortitude and wisdom of the Oak. If wounded, she can transform herself into an oak. In oak shape her powers over the earth and the wild are heightened, but her powers over storms are lessened.
