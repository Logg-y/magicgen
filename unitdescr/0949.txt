Sometimes a Raptor is born with black wings. This is a sure sign of greatness and the youngster is trained either as a Harab Seraph or a Raven Guard, the Raptor clan elites. The Raptor Clan Caelians aren't cold resistant, so the Raven Guards don plate cuirasses in battle. They fight with dagger and sword, a deadly combination. Raven Guards are stealthy and are often used to strike deep into enemy territory.
