When the Telkhine kingdom was shattered and cast beneath the waves most of the Therodian population was killed. The Kouretes lived close to the center where the cataclysm hit the hardest and many of them were killed even if they could have survived the floods. The ghosts of Kouretes now dance the sacred war-dances unaware of their cursed state of existence. Together with human spectres they march with the armies of Therodos to follow the will of the awakening Lord.
