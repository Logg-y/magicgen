The Savaran Guard is the elite force and bodyguard of the Shah. They are taken from the most prominent Savaran and are given the best armor available. Being the pride of the army, they are only used when a battle looks uncertain. The Turans ride the fabled Nisean warhorses. The Turans are descendants of Abysians, masters of breeding, and when they found the Nisean horses, they bred them to perfection. Bred with demon steeds, they have become stronger and more ferocious than any other breed of horses. They are also bred to be somewhat resistant to fire.
