It is rumored that there is a great city in the God Forest where apes rule instead of men. Few believed this myth until Mwaka arrived. Dressed in a cloak colored royal scarlet and crowned as a king, he marched up with his retinue to the Great Throne of the King Triumphant and swore his allegiance in exchange for one hundred and one wives and the release of the Ape Oracle, an ape of uncanny intelligence that had been captured a month earlier. The Voices of the Lord thought that if the powers of the Oracle were not enough to save her from being captured, she posed no danger and so was released. Mwaka now serves the God of the Forest and ever more apes are coming to his aid.
