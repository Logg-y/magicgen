The Neter is a giant of divine heritage. He was once given rulership of the world by a previous Pantokrator, but was slain and dismembered by his brother. His wife reassembled him and returned him to life, but his master's decree forbid him to return to the land of the living. Instead he became a King of the Dead. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Neter of the Underworld is free to break the laws of death and return to the land of the living and claim it as his. The Neter of the Underworld is always accompanied by ancient warriors from the Underworld.
