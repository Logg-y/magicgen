It is rumored that there is a great city in the God Forest where apes rule instead of men. Few believed this myth until the Ape Oracle was found. The Oracle is an ape of uncanny intelligence that was captured by an Eye of the Lord after she and her band caused some unrest in a remote region of the kingdom. The Oracle proved to be quite clever, but not clever enough to avoid capture. It was released by the Voices of the Lord when Mwaka, the Crowned Ape, arrived and made a plea for the Oracle's life. Mchumba seems to be only slightly brighter than an ordinary Ape, but she has some innate magical powers.
