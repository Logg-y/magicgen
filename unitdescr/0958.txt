The Colossal Head is a powerful spirit that inhabits a massive stone that has been chiseled into the shape of a head. The spirit cannot leave the Colossal Head, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and it is also magically powerful. In a physical battle, the head would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.
