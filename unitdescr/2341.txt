With the arrival of the Vanir, human sages gathered in Novg√•rd and the newly founded Vanarusian cities to learn and practice the magic of the Vanir. The Vanir were innately magical and weren't particularly interested in magical research. The human sages on the other hand were intent on acquiring magical might. These sages founded a magic tradition combining the wild magic of the Vyedun and the magic of the Vanir. The Vanarusian sages have become a powerful asset to the Vanir as skilled magic researchers, but their magic might is lesser than that of their masters.
