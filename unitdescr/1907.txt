With the coming of the Lawgiver, the religious structure of Mictlan was altered. Blood sacrifices have been abolished and the Sky, abode of the Lawgiver, has received a new and important role. From the skies He observes the actions of the Mictlan people and judges them accordingly. In the skies His two faces, the Sun and the Moon, smile upon the righteous and give them strength of heart and prophetic dreams. From the skies falls the life-giving Rain and from the skies comes harsh judgment in the form of thunder. The High Priests of the Sky have become the most influential priests of the new faith and only the Priest Kings, as temporal leaders and makers of the law, have the same authority. The High Priests of the Sky are skilled in Air magic, but do also have some powers over the other manifestations of the God. These are the Sun, Moon, Rain and the Land. As representatives of the Lawgiver, they have the power to judge and observe the people and have a bonus when patrolling a province.
