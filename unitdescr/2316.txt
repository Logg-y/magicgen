The Dragon King is a primordial dragon put in charge of the Eastern Sea by the previous Pantokrator. For millennia he ruled the ocean and brought storms and tidal waves to the coasts of men. When he allowed the Pillar of the East to be stolen by an annoying little monkey, he was punished by eternal imprisonment. Now with the Pantokrator gone, his prison is crumbling, and the world will once more bow before the Dragon King of the East. In true shape the Dragon King is a serpentine monster with tigers claws and shimmering scales of a carp. It is able to run in the air and swim in the water. It is a master of water magic, but has difficulties mastering other forms of magic. It can take the shape of a dragon headed celestial dignitary more suited for spellcasting. It loses some of its powers in dragon shape.
