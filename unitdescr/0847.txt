The Hangadrott is an ancient Helkarl who has hung himself from an ash tree to gain knowledge in the dark arts. For ages, they withdrew to Helhalla where the dead pass by on their way to the Underworld, but they have returned with the coming of the New God. A few of these ancient mages still survive and they have great influence over the affairs of the Vanir of Helheim. Hangadrotts wear magical lightweight armor.
