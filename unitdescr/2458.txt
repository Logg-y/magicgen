Longnu is the grand daughter of the Dragon King. Once she lived in his palace of pearls in the Eastern Ocean, but now she is a loyal follower of the Bodhisattva of mercy. After having prevented a village of fishermen from eating an exceptionally large and tasty fish the Bodhisattva of Mercy released it into the ocean. The fish then transformed back into its true dragon shape and returned to its father, the Dragon King. The grateful father sent as a gift of thanks his most precious possession, the Pearl of Light. The gift was accepted only on the condition that the messenger, who was also the Dragon King's grand daughter, would take the pearl. The Dragon Girl accepted, and the two have been inseparable ever since. Longnu still carries her grand father's Pearl of Light
