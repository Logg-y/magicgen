The Great Black Bull is a divine bull that has ravaged the world since time immemorial. The Black Bull is a creature of unbridled fury and a manifestation of the blind rage of Nature, the inhuman wildness, the glory of the slayer and the slain. Unlike his brother, the Great White Bull, with whom he has fought for dominance on several legendary occasions, the fertility aspect of the Black Bull is secondary to that of his maddened rage. Now that Ascension draws close, he leads his people to once again wildly embrace the mindless abandon and bloodlust of Nature aroused.
