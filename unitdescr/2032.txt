The Ba'als are Rephaite Lords and favored by the Nephilim. Living lives of luxury and splendor, they lead their kin in the absence of the Nephilim. Having godlike puissance and absolute power over their subjects has made them arrogant and depraved. Surrounded by loyal Rephaim and Avvite slaves, they were quite unaware of the growing resentment of the Avvim and several Ba'als and Melqarts were killed in uprisings. To preserve order, they created a cult of Nephilim-worship and created the order of the Kohanim. After the cult was established, the Melqarts became deluded, called themselves gods and drank the blood of the Avvim to gain their strength. The Ba'als followed suit and have turned into bloodthirsty God-kings who threaten the world. The Ba'als are born with the power of their father, but they rarely learn other magical paths.
