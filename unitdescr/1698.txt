The authority of the Abysian Warlords is limited to acts of war. In all other matters, Abysia is ruled by the Anathemants and the Anointed of Rhuax. Anathemant Salamanders are lowly priests of the Abysian Flame Cult. Anathemants excel in Fire magic and use fire not only to incinerate infidels, but also to feed the anger inherent in the hearts of all Abysian warriors. The Anathemants practice human sacrifice to empower their Master's Dominion by the magic inherent in human blood. Anathemant Salamanders are Abysians and radiate the hellish heat characteristic of their race.
