The Fir Bolg are the descendants of the Nemedians, a proud race that once warred with the Fomorian giants. The Nemedians were beaten and their Fir Bolg descendants accepted Fomorian rule. But the Fir Bolg spread and multiplied and conquered lands of their own. Soon they formed a kingdom apart from the Fomorian lands, but then came the Tuatha. The Tuatha were also descendants of the Nemedians, but their powers were greater by far. With enchanted spears and spellsongs they quickly conquered the land of the Fir Bolg and settled on the Isle of Tir na n'Og, the Land of the Ever Young. Fir Bolg now compose much of the population and serve as farmers and lowly warriors of the kingdom. They are somewhat larger than humans and have long lifespans, but they have lost or forgotten much of their Nemedian legacy. Fir Bolg use armaments made from bronze and leather.
