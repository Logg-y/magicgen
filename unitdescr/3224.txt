In earlier times the Younger Cyclopes lived pastoral lives herding mouflon sheep on the gentle slopes of the Phlegran hills, but even during these times they sometimes joined the armies of the Tyrants. They made themselves a name as skilled, albeit under-equipped warriors. When the Tyrants and Gigantes of Phlegra degenerated, became more monstrous, and finally disappeared, their control over the kingdom dwindled. In practice the human population slowly became masters of the kingdom and the Cyclopes were marginalized. With growing hubris mankind rebelled against their masters and tried to take control over the capital Telepylos. They were almost successful, but their attempt was thwarted by the Cyclopes. The Cyclope Smiths shackled under the fortress were released by the last Tyrant and the Cyclopes were rewarded with influence and power. The Younger Cyclopes were given arms of cyclopean manufacture and became a noble warrior-caste aloof from the human population. The cyclopean armors are not as splendid as the hoplite armors once used by the Gigantes of Mekone, but they are superior to most other armors.
Cyclopes are known for their fondness for throwing things, large and small. In this age when they have been equipped with armaments forged by their greater kin, javelins have replaced the boulders carried by the warriors of earlier times.
