With the coming of civilization, the ways of old are abandoned and replaced by new habits and practices of human origin. With little need for their priestly services, dryads no longer leave their brethren in search of a Sacred Grove. Their role as priestesses and caretakers of Nature has ended. Influenced by the manners of the centaurs, they have become part of an emerging nobility. They have turned their skills to new uses to preserve their religious authority. Trained as sacred warriors of the growing nation, the dryads have become a formidable and important part of the Pangaean army. Dryads were blessed in ancient times with aphrodisiac beauty and few mortals can think of harming them. The awe does not affect undead or mindless beings.
