Trolls are robust, humanoid creatures with stone-like skin. While most trolls live in caves in the wilderness, there are some that form small kingdoms under the rule of a mighty troll king. These trolls are skilled craftsmen and make weapons and armor from iron. A troll moose knight is a heavily armed elite troll warrior mounted on a great moose.
