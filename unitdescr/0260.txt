The Censors were judges in the old Empire and now they are revived by black magic to serve the Empire once more. They are armored in rusty plate hauberks and wield battle axes in the fashion of the Lictor. Censors can only be revived with the use of strong magic. They are so closely connected with the Netherworld that they are surrounded by a wind of numbing cold. Censors are corporeal undead with leathery, dried flesh that can withstand much damage.
