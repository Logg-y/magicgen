The humans of Therodos were struck hardest by the cataclysm. Those who survived the initial blast drowned when the land sunk underneath the waves. Once dead their shattered souls were barred from entering the underworld and their ghosts remained in the sunken lands they once inhabited, unaware of their undead state of existence. The Ephoroi were once magistrates and leaders of the human population of Therodos. They presided over religious ceremonies where the Meliai were not present. Now they are the leaders of the ghostly realm of the drowned dead, serving the Hekaterides and their Meliai daughters as they did before the fall. The Ephoroi are able to call human spectres to fill the ranks of the ghostly armies.
