The Hekaterides are female Daktyloi, semi-divine beings of the sunken kingdom of Therodos. Unlike their male counterparts, they are not of dwarven stature, but tall, slender and beautiful. They are the inventors of dance and gave their skills and blessings to the human inhabitants of Therodos. During the Telkhine reign the Hekaterides gave birth to a race of goat-like half-men. The Daktyloi disclaimed paternity of the satyrs, denounced their sisters and secluded themselves in caves and hidden forges. The satyrs were expelled from the realm and hid in faraway forests where they eventually were found and adopted by the Panii. The male Daktyloi were always reclusive and concerned themselves more with their crafts than with humans. Their Hekateride sisters on the other hand were very much involved with the human population and became queens and priestesses under the Telkhine God-kings. With their sacred dances they brought joy and fertility to the lands. Now the Therodian ghosts follow them in death as they once did in life, dancing to the clamor of cymbals.
