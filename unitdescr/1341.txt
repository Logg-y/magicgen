The Devi of Darkness is a huge four-armed divinity with a horrible appearance. She was once given power to battle demons by a previous Pantokrator, but her destructive fury made him banish her eternally to save the world from her rage. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator the raging devi has broken free and will subjugate and destroy all demons and likely the world as well. The Devi of Darkness is a slayer of demons and she holds a demon head in her hand and a bowl into which blood from the head constantly pours. Demon blood also pours from her open mouth. The Devi wields a sword which thirsts for demon blood and a trident that forces demons to halt.
