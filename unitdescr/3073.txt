The Kami of the Moon is the son of the previous Pantokrator. Together with his brother and sister he was brought into existence when the Pantokrator grieved after banishing his wife to the netherworld. When he wiped his right eye a divine spark was set free and hastened to the heavens. Watching the spark he called it son. After giving his daughter the mandate of the sun the Pantokrator grudgingly gave his son the mandate of the moon and the night. But when the people of the world started to worship the sun and the moon instead of him, the Pantokrator got jealous and imprisoned them for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Kami of the Moon is breaking free. The Kami of the Moon is sometimes called upon to deliver his followers from deadly diseases.
