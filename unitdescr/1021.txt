Ulrich Patrifagus was the son of the Baron and Castellan of the Keep of Ulm. During the civil war, his father died and Ulrich inherited his father's title. Soon thereafter, the Keep was besieged. Though inexperienced, he kept his vigil and defended the Keep day and night until the Malediction hit his starving army. When the sky turned black, he despaired and opened his father's tomb to ask for advice, but the unholy Hunger struck him and in utter horror he found himself feasting upon his father's decaying corpse. Realizing what he had done, he relinquished his remaining sanity and commanded his starving soldiers to feed upon their dead comrades. Those who had the strength to refuse the order were slaughtered and eaten by soldiers of lesser moral stature. Ulrich still commands the Ghoul Guardians and can arouse the Hunger in humans by forcing them to feed upon each other. Ulrich was once a Guardian and a hunter of heretics. Now he is surrounded by an aura unbearable to sacred beings.
