The Nerid is an underwater being born at the dawn of time, when the sea was untamed and filled with monstrous beings. She was given power over life in the forests of the shallow seas by a previous Pantokrator. But hubris found her and she gave wisdom and mind to the beasts of the sea, making them aware of her presence. The awakened half-men gave her their devotion and prayers as though she was a god. The Pantokrator was furious and banished his rebellious servant for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Nerid is once more free to receive the prayers of men and beasts. The Nerid is aquatic and cannot leave her maritime realm.
