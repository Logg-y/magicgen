This Idol has been around for a very long time and it has always been the most popular place to give your offerings. Through the ages warriors have offered it valuables to receive courage in battle, wives have offered food before giving birth and the Idol of Men has continued to grow in power. Countless offerings later and now with the Pantokrator gone, the Idol of Men has the chance of putting the world under its strong dominion and become the True God.
