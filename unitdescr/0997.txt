The Eater of the Dead is a huge, amorphous mass of semi-liquefied, dead flesh. Arms, legs and half-melted heads are extended and retracted from the putrid mass, surrounded by an overpowering smell of decay. The Eater of the Dead was once banished to the Void by the previous Pantokrator. Now some foolish mage has recalled it in the vain hope that it can be controlled. The Eater of the Dead will follow commands as long as it is not allowed to feast on too much flesh and grow to its previous full power. The Eater of the Dead will consume unburied corpses in order to grow in power.
