The Melissai, the honey bees, are arcoscephalian priestesses raised and trained in monasteries far from city life. Their training includes the study of Nature magic and the healing arts. Some of them have learned the arts of the mountain nymphs and have skills in air magic as well. Upon reaching full sisterhood, the Melissa may leave her monastery to serve the awakening god and tend the sick and wounded, a work at which they are unsurpassed. The Melissai are peaceful and rarely join armies.
