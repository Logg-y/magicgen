Ditan is the reborn memory of an ancient Rephaite king, deified and worshiped by his descendants. He is honored as the most benevolent of the ancient kings and his name is mentioned in ceremonies for the dead and the newly born. He is a bringer of fertility in life and comfort in death. Of all the ancient kings, Ditan was the most renowned and was at all times accompanied by heroes known as the assembly of Ditan, the Ditanim. Now they remain in Sheol awaiting their master's call. While less depraved than most Malikum, Ditan is still a demon king, inherently mad from a legacy of utter sin.
