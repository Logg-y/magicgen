Ba'an Rachis is the leader of the Abysian murder cult. He is the result of a singularly successful breeding experiment more then a century ago. Some claim he has demon blood in his veins, others claim he is dragon blooded. Those who might have known died when Ba'an Rachis was born. He was trained as a Slayer and is supposed to have killed thousands since he was unleashed upon the world. When the murder cult was formed, Ba'an Rachis was quickly promoted and received Anathemant training. His longevity and his reputation as a Slayer have made him a living legend.
