The Anakim are pureblooded descendants of the Nephilim and the greatest of the Rephaim. They are deathly pale six-fingered giants with great horns and tremendous strength. With the destruction of Kiriath Sepher, the City of Books, Ashdod and Ashkelon are the only cities where the blood of the Nephilim is still running strong. The Adon is an Anakite lord of the Twin Cities, bestowed with temporal and religious power. The Adon is king, judge, priest and prophet to his brethren. The Adon presides at the funerary banquets for the deified dead and is the most important religious figure besides the devoured one. The blood of the Nephilim runs strong in his veins and he was born with magic powers. Innately gifted with magical powers, they rarely take the time to research magic. The Anakim adorn themselves with jewelry and practice the cosmetic arts taught by the Watchers. Being a king, the Adon drapes himself in enchanted necklaces, rings and bracelets.
