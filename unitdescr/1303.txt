While most Jotuns farm and fight for their local Herse, an increasing number has chosen a martial career with the imminent Awakening of the Lord. If their chieftain is rich they may equip themselves with armors of metal-reinforced leather, but most use inexpensive armors of fur and leather. The spear is the most popular weapon, but axes and javelins are also used.
