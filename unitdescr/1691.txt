Auluudh is the eldest surviving member of an ancient race sprung from the depths of the ocean. The Aboleths have no formal leaders, but everyone serves the ancient Mind Lords and Auluudh is the oldest and most powerful of them. Auluudh is the closest thing to a regent there is in the depths. The recent emergence of leadership among the ever more numerous Deep Ones is a cause of concern to the Mind Lord. To strengthen his grip over the Deep Ones and the Tritons, Auluudh has quested to further his knowledge of distant stars. This search has led him to shallow waters where he has discovered other beings to enslave. The mermen and their mages will serve a purpose as stargazers and communicants should the power of the distant stars be needed.
