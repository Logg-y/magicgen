The first Abysians sprung from the Fires of Rhuax were large magmatic beings, barely resembling humans at all. Slowly these monstrosities developed into humanoids. With every generation, the Fires of Rhuax grew cooler in their bodies and the flaming Children of Rhuax became smoldering Abysians. Abysians of prominent heritage are larger and surrounded by flames. They are called Burning Ones and are sacred to the degenerates. Only Burning Ones can become high priests of the Flame Cult, the Anointed of Rhuax, and they are the undisputed rulers of the Abysians. The Anointed Ones have formed the Order of the Anathemants to administer ceremonies and burn offerings in the many temples of the kingdom.
