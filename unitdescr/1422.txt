Civateteo are noblewomen who died in childbirth and have been called back to haunt the living. They are dressed in dark, tattered robes and their faces and arms are covered with white chalk. They are shriveled and terrible to behold. They often haunt crossroads and graveyards where they stalk unwary travelers. They have priestly powers as well as skill in the dark arts.
