The Neokoros is an arcoscephalian priestess and temple-warden. The priestly occupation in Arcoscephale has been restricted to women for a long time. The priestesses of this age no longer get their training in monasteries but in the temples of the cities of the kingdom. A Neokoros rarely leaves her temple, but occasionally follows an army to tend the sick and wounded.
