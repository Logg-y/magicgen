Over a century ago Emberstream, an ancient Oracle of Subterranean Waters, gave birth to a swarm of strange larvae. With the upper bodies of Pale Ones and the lower parts of the Great Olms of the Deeps, their birth was seen as an omen of great importance. Their mother died shortly after and the father of her progeny was never revealed. The Olm Spawn were fostered and trained by the great Oracles and serve Agartha as priests and mage generals.
