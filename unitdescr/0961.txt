The Titan of the Sea is a huge demigod sprung from the depths of the ocean. He was given power over the sea and the rumbling earth by a previous Pantokrator. Afraid of his destructive powers, men began to worship him as though he was a God. The Pantokrator was furious and banished his servant for eternity. Now that the Pantokrator is gone, the Earth Shaker is once more free to shatter cities and receive the prayers of men. The Titan of the Sea can leave the ocean and grant humans the ability to breathe underwater.
