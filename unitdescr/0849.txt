The Daoine Sidhe are descendants of the Tuatha who once ruled Eriu. With the defeat of the Tuatha, the Sidhe retreated into strange and magical lands. The entrances into these faery realms were often hidden in the mounds of ancient kings. But this retreat sealed the fate of the Sidhe, because men did not respect dead kings. One by one, the gateways into the lands of the Sidhe were destroyed. Now, only a few of them remain. With the coming of the new God, man was seduced into servitude and the Sidhe have returned from their seclusion to rule the human population of the kingdom. Daoine Sidhe despise iron and instead fight with ancient armaments of bronze and leather. They are masters of glamour and illusion and can hide their true appearance.
