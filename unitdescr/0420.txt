The Caelians of the Airya clan were blessed in ancient times by the Mainyus of the cold winter and are resistant to cold. Airyas make poor fighters. They are of lighter stock than humans and their wings make them slow in hand-to-hand combat. Most Airyas avoid martial occupations, but their remarkable resistance to cold is valued. Their ice blades are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings and the magical ice in their ice studded armor tempers and hardens in cold provinces.
