Marius Lorca was born the son of a lowly peasant. He enlisted in the legions and gained the rank of Centurion. When he single-handedly saved the Emperor from the daggers of a dozen assassins, he was placed in the Emerald Guard. He became the first low-born Emerald Lord and served the Emperor proudly until he was seduced by the Empress, who had the Emperor murdered and then discarded Marius Lorca. As a result, he vowed to avoid the politics and machinations of the Imperial court, painted his armor black and rejoined the Pythian war machine. Marius is called the Black Emerald in the Legion and has become a living legend.
