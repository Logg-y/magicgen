The Fountain of Blood is a horrible spirit that inhabits an unholy fountain that spews forth blood instead of water. The spirit possesses a girl to serve as its instrument. The chosen child is blinded and rendered unable to do anything but speak the will of the spirit. At the age of thirteen, she is sacrificed and replaced with a new girl, born the day the previous girl was made the voice of the spirit. The unholy spirit is immobile and cannot leave the fountain it inhabits. It can possess willing targets to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The Fountain of Blood is tremendously strong in its Dominion and magically powerful. Its eerie wails attract weak souls and the unholy spirit is most efficient in finding virgins for sacrifice. Anyone wishing to harm the fountain will flee in panic once the eerie wailing pierces his soul. The fountain can be destroyed, but not easily.
