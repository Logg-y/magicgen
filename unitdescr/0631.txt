The King of Elemental Fire is a physical manifestation of the wild magic of Fire. Only three such spirits are known to exist and since the fall of Catharsis, there are but two that are pure. Pyriphlogos has a body of flames and sulphur and appears as a huge, crowned king. The King of Elemental Fire is innately skilled in Fire magic and is constantly surrounded by a very powerful fire shield. Pyriphlogos is totally unable to enter underwater provinces, but he is able to create fire elementals by giving life to fires.
