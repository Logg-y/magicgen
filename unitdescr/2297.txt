The Lion Queens are the consorts of the Lion Kings. Their temporal and religious power are slightly less then their consorts', but their magical powers are considerable, being semi-divine and blessed from birth. Recently there was a schism in the royal family. A conspiracy was discovered by Spider's servants and a whole branch of the royal family were executed. A few young queens escaped the massacre and fled to the Phoenix City where they took over the local cult. Now the royalty of Machaka are intent on destroying Berytos and the rebel queens.
