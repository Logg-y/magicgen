An Onmyo-ji is an ancient practitioner of Onmyo astrology. When men came to the land of the Bakemono, they brought with them a magical tradition based on astrology and the Way of the Five Elements. The Onmyo-ji are the last of these diviners. The few remaining Onmyo-ji have mastered their own mortality and lived for centuries. The Onmyo-ji are not truly immortal and are reluctant to join armies where their long lives might end prematurely. Most Onmyo-ji have bound or befriended shikigami, familiar kami, that aid them in divination and protect them from aggressors.
