The Ishib is a priest of the old faith trained and ordained in the House of Water. As newly-founded cities erected temples of their own the Ishibs lost some of their former influence. The Ensi of Eridu was replaced by the Entu of the Moon as the highest religious authority in the kingdom, but the Ishibs, sequestered in their House of Water, did not react. A Great Temple of the Moon was erected in another city and religious influence was transferred from the Ishibs and the House of Water to this new center. Now the Ishibs are merely relics of the old faith.
