Ragha, and Tur before that, is a stratified society. Pure-blooded Turan nobles avoid intermingling with the lower classes. The Turan nobles, Azatan, form a warrior caste of skilled fighters. Since Tur lost contact with Abysia, new forms of battle tactics have evolved. Horses, unusable by pure-blooded Abysians, have become popular and much of the Turan armies are mounted. The Turans ride the fabled Nisean warhorses. The Turans are descendants of Abysians, masters of breeding, and when they found the Nisean horses, they bred them to perfection. Bred with demon steeds, they have become stronger and more ferocious than any other breed of horses. They are also somewhat resistant to fire. The Savaran are heavily armed mounted elites from the Azatan noble class. They are deployed on the flanks while the War Elephants form the center of an army.
