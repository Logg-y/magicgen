Under the influence of the Void, people dream of strange and mind-defying places. Most men under the influence of the strange Dreams of R'lyeh will sooner or later lose their minds. These Mad Ones no longer hear the Dreams, but have received the blessing of a refined mind. They intuitively know the will of the Void and act accordingly. In other words, they don't act at all unless led by mages or other madmen.
