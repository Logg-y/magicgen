Everything left by the Ancient Ones has become subject to worship by the humans of Agartha. Statues left in halls underneath the Earth are adored and worshiped, enchanted and given magical life by the Golem Crafters. The greatest of these statues are the ones of ancient Oracles. Some remnant of an ancient Oracle's memory gives the Marble Oracle a will and a mind. These telestic animates lumber to and fro in the underground city of Agartha looking for faithless humans. Sometimes they stop and raise their hands in the air in a gesture of worship or desperation. Visitors who have returned from the underground city would say that the Marble Oracles are looking for a purpose. With the coming of the New God, there is a purpose and the Marble Oracles march.
