The Protogenos of the Sea is a divine spirit given might and creative powers by a previous Pantokrator. When the sea and everything in it was created the Pantokrator no longer needed the spirit and imprisoned it, lest it might think it was a God of the sea with authority to rival the Pantokrator himself. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the prison is crumbling and the Protogenos of the Sea is free to claim as his all seas and lands which on waters rest. The Protogenos of the Sea manifests itself as a huge bearded head rising up from the waves. It is crowned with crab claws on its brow as a sign of its divine nature. It is strongly connected to the sea and can never leave it, regardless of magical help.
