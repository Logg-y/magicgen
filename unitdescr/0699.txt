When the ways of man came to the ancient woods, the centaurs were the first to adopt the new ways. They donned bronze armor and fought in formations like the soldiers of other nations. As civilization spread, the centaurs forgot the old ways in their attempt to mimic human society. A new class of nobility emerged as the leaders of the halfmen learned the arts of trade and war and the centaurs became lords and rulers of the halfmen. The centaur cataphracts of this New Era don steel armor and lances and are in every way as powerful as the knights of mankind.
