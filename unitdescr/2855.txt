The Floating Mind is an ancient entity of the depths. It was born at the dawn of time, when monsters and strange things roamed the world. The Floating Mind has a gelatinous body that harbors a mind of vast abilities. It can project its will and thoughts upon other beings and it was worshiped by the first sentient beings of the sea. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned false gods and monsters that threatened his creation. As the one intellect greater than his, the Pantokrator fettered the Floating Mind at the bottom of the deepest gorge. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Floating Mind is once more free to dominate lesser minds of the ocean depths. The Floating Mind is blind and orients itself with powers of mind and magic.
