The Hyena Clan is the least trusted of all clans, but they have some influence due to their skills. Hyena is the one who brought heat, fire and metalcrafting to the land. He was the one who let Lion defeat Rhino with spears longer than the Rhino's horn. Hyena is also the bringer and watcher of death. His followers are able to cause and cure diseases and their skills are needed in most villages. Hyena's followers dislike the triumph of Lion and take any chance they can to mock him.
