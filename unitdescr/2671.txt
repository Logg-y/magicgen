When the Zotz swarmed the forests of Mictlan they encountered armored enemies. The technology of the humans was adopted by elite warriors, despite being cumbersome. These Zotz are more heavily armed and serve primarily as guards of the caverns and the Xibalban priests. They are sometimes used in conquest, but their size and limited strength make them inferior to most surface-dwelling warriors anyway.
