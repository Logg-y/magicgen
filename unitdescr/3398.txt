The Jarnvidjur are ancient Gygjas of the Iron Wood instructed in the art of Seith by Angerboda herself. They are from an earlier era and remember the time when frost covered the world and the Niefel Giants walked the earth. When the frost giants disappeared the oldest and mightiest of the Gygjas sequestered themselves in the Iron Wood for centuries, but with the Awakening, they have emerged anew to lead the giants of Jotunheim. The Jarnvidjur are mighty sorceresses adept in blood magic, crossbreeding and the practice of Seith. They craft the enchanted wolf pelts used by the Ulfhednar and plan the fate of the world.
