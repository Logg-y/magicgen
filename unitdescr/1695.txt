The Basalt City is ruled by the Basalt Queens and their consorts. The rulership is divided between the Priestess Queens and the Mage Kings, but the actual leadership of the emerging nation is a matter for the Basalt Queens. The Basalt Kings sequester themselves, staring into the Dark Crystal at the bottom of the gorge in the center of the city. The Basalt Queens rarely concern themselves with matters outside the Basalt City and few have ever been seen except during stormy nights on the docks of isolated villages. Religious matters outside the Basalt City are left to the Mothers of the Deep.
