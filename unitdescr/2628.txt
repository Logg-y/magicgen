The Zhayedan, Immortals, is a Turan sacred elite force of limited numbers, replaced only when one of their numbers is slain. Once they were an infantry unit, but with the increasing interest in mounted warfare and the acquisition of gryphons from a tribe of Amazons, the Immortals became an airborne cavalry unit of unequaled power. If the Zhayedan is killed, his gryphon will fight on, and if the gryphon is returned to Ragha another Zhayedan will mount the riderless Gryphon.
