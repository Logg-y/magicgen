Angelique was a simple peasant girl who witnessed the destruction of her home village at the hands of the Inquisition. Before the blazing flames, she swore to avenge her family. For years she fought the Inquisition as best she could, be it alone or with brigands. But a horrible incident changed her utterly. After witnessing her brigand friends feasting upon the flesh of a slain Friar, she abandoned them and went to the Inquisition to confess her sins. She was tested in the House of Just Fires and was deemed righteous and given absolution. Angelique now serves the Inquisition with a burning hatred of Ermorian heretics.
