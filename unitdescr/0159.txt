The Monument is a powerful spirit that inhabits an enormous stone construction. The spirit cannot leave the monument, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and it is also magically powerful. In a physical battle, the monument would probably be impossible to destroy, even though it cannot strike back without using magic. The monument is completely immobile and cannot move even by magic.
