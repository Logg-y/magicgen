This Idol has been around for a very long time and for farmers and hunters this is the most important place to give their offerings. Through the ages hunters have offered it animal hearts for good fortune, farmers have offered it food when their animals got sick and people in general have made a yearly offering to appease the wolves. During the night a wolf of extraordinary size would take the offerings and if you did not make your yearly sacrifice the wolf would take you as well. Countless offerings later and now with the Pantokrator gone, the Idol of Beasts has the chance of putting the world under its strong dominion and become the True God.
