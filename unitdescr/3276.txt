Cynocephalians are dog-headed beast-men living in the mountains between Kailasa and the Sauromatian steppes. They dress in animal hides and live in caves instead of houses. The richest wear linen clothing bought from the few brave merchants who traverse their lands. The Cynocephalians hunt with bows and eat their food raw. They sometimes raid neighboring lands, but have never fielded an organized army, nor has there ever been a cynocephalian kingdom.
