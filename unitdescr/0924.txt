An iron pig is the result of an ordinary domestic pig transformed into a being of flesh and steel. Only the hide and outer layers of flesh of the pig are transformed. The transformed pig is slower than before. It isn't aware that it is less vulnerable and has the morale and discipline of an ordinary pig.
