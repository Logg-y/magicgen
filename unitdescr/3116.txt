The Archons are magistrates and sages of the City of Gold and Marble. They wield great magical powers and serve as priests of the god-slayer, refuting the faiths of false gods. All Mekonean Gigantes serve in the military and Archons are no exception, but tradition and old decrees dictate that they cannot command great armies.
