The Yllerion, the Bird of Splendor, is a magnificent bird of flaming colors with wings as sharp as razors and claws of burning gold. All birds in creation follow their command and gather to witness their demise and rebirth. Only two such birds exist and should one die the other one is escorted by birds and plunge into the sea, drowning itself. Then two new birds are born from the flaming eggs in their nest.
