The Moloch is an infernal angel called or sent from beyond. Winged and dressed in horror, he will crush this world and make its inhabitants slaughter one another and suffer the torment of the Inferno. The Moloch is a powerful and mighty warrior and demonic servants will come to his aid whenever he goes into battle. The Moloch will surely shatter the world unless he is vanquished.
