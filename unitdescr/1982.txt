With the emerging conflict between the Master Smiths and the Black Priests, some smiths accepted the new cult and became ordained as lowly priests of the Iron Faith. This made them accepted by the priests, but they lost influence in society, being considered cowards and turncoats. They have since found the means to imbue their craft with divine might. Their most accomplished work to date is the Black Halberds used by the Guardians of the Keep of Ulm.
