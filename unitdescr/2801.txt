The Linnormr is a monstrous reptile born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It is surrounded by noxious fumes that slay plant and beast alike. The very land where the Great Serpent dwelled withered and died. It made its home beneath the World Tree and gnawed on its roots, threatening to destroy the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Linnormr was imprisoned for eternity, lest the World Tree would wither and the world with it. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the noxious fumes of the horrible serpent can once more be felt in the world.
