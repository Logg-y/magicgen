Dryads are female satyrs. They are similar in appearance to male satyrs but have white fur on their hindquarters. Dryads are blessed with aphrodisiac beauty and male humans find it very difficult to strike them down even in the heat of battle. They can also use their wild beauty to lure men away into the deep woods of Pangaea. Dryads are priestesses of the Sacred Groves and revered by all the wild beings of Pangaea.
