A siege golem is a metal giant with fists enchanted to shatter steel and stone. It is tremendously strong and can crush stone walls to powder. The main purpose of the siege golem is to besiege castles and it is rather poor at melee combat, although it is very durable and will not easily be destroyed unless its controller dies. A single siege golem counts as one hundred normal soldiers when besieging a castle.
