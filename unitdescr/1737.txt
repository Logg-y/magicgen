A black-skinned demon-ogre of the wild forests. It feasts on the flesh of monkeys and men and is greatly feared. Rakshasas have ravenous appetites and are best kept well fed. Most Rakshasas are found in the demon kingdom of Lanka, but some are summoned by unscrupulous monkey sorcerers. Rakshasa warriors use heavy cudgels and scale armor. Rakshasas are descendants of the Danavas and Daityas of ancient times and are vulnerable to fire.
