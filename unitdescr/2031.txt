There are several races of giants in the land of Hinnom. The Rephaim are the sons of the Nephilim and the rulers of the land. They are huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers. They have been taught all kinds of secrets by their fathers and are born with magical powers. A Melqart is a king and ruler of a city and a descendant of Azazel. Azazel revealed the secrets of war, weapons and cosmetics to the Avvim, and his legacy runs strong in the blood of the Melqarts. The Melqarts have gruesome appetites and many of them feast on the flesh of their smaller kin. Some cities have actually been destroyed in horrible blood feasts at the whim of a Melqart. With the Nephilim-worship, the Melqarts became sons of gods and they have deluded themselves that they are strengthened by the sacrifice of blood. They have started to demand blood sacrifices to keep their hideous banquets overflowing with fresh flesh.
