The Old Man of the Sea is possibly the oldest of all the underwater beings born at the dawn of time, when the sea was untamed and filled with monstrous beings. Wise beyond compare he was given power to guide the new-born races of the deeps by a previous Pantokrator. But regardless of his wishes, the tritons begun to worship him as though he was a god. When the Old Man of the Sea mentioned this to the Pantokrator, his master grew jealous and banished his servant for eternity, leaving the races of the deeps bereft of magical guidance. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Old Man of the Sea is returning to bring wisdom and magic understanding to the races of the deeps. The Old Man of the Sea is able to leave the sea and can bring land-living beings with him into the sea.
