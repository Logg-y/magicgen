The Flamen were mage-priests of the Old Faith. They performed the ceremonies and burn offerings to the Numina. With the coming of the New Faith, they had to adopt the new doctrines or suffer. The Flamen lost influence and power, but are still important in the marginal areas of the empire. The Bishops of Eldregate proclaimed that the Numina of Natural Phenomena were aspects of the Awakening God, and thus the skills of the Flamen were kept in the empire. All Flamen have some skill in Fire magic and most are also skilled in a second Element or Nature magic.
