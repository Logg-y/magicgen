The warriors of the Mictlan armies use spears, hide shields and unsophisticated ranged weapons such as javelins and slings. Most wear heavy, crude armor made of leather, wood and bone, often adorned with feathers. Feather plumed helmets are worn by more prominent fighters. Since the development of copperworking, some warriors have donned copper scale armor.
