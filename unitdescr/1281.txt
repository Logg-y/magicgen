The Iron Crafters are the successors of the Ice Crafters of High Caelum. With the return of the Raptors, iron was more sorely needed than the expensive ice of earlier times. Ice crafting has been all but abandoned, but the skills in item forging have remained in the kingdom. Iron Crafters are Earth mages specializing in magical forging and use less gems when forging items.
