When the first Mictlan colony was founded beneath the sea, former Atlantians immigrated to the safety of the citadel in the deep. Rain Warriors and Rain Priests from the jungles of Mictlan along with Atlantian refugees previously hiding in gorges and deep kelp forests flocked to the call of the colony's founders. Soon a new breed of mage-priests emerged in the deeps. Led by Mothers endowed with the powers of the vast sea, the colonies have become a power to rival the Rain Kings of Mictlan themselves.
