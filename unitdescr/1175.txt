The Sauromatians are ruled by women. This is a legacy of their merging with the Amazon tribes in times past. The Amazon leaders were not accepted, as they were not warriors, but they influenced the Sauromatians and women warriors gained power and influence. All prominent tribes are ruled by warrior queens. Only the Androphags have totally rejected the notion of female leadership. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The number of tattoos represent standing in society and the warrior queens are thoroughly covered in dark etchings.
