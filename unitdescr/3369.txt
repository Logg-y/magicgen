The Ilahat is a giant of divine heritage. A previous Pantokrator gave her mandate over the planets and Fate itself. Thus the fate of men was hers to decide. When mankind realized her influence over their lives, they began to worship her as a God. The Pantokrator was furious, imprisoned her for eternity and gave the Mandate of Fate to a better suited candidate. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Ilahat is free to once more decide the Fate of the world.
