The Nephilim are the tainted offspring of the Grigori. When the Grigori approached the Avvim and taught them the secrets of science, the Angels fell to lust and took wives among the Avvim. Their offspring became the Nephilim, giants of godlike power. The Grigori were cast down and imprisoned in the infernal realms for their sins, but the Nephilim were partly of this world and could not be banished by the Celestial Powers. The Nephilim made themselves kings over the Avvim, and they fathered sons who became known as the Rephaim. The Nephilim had unnatural appetites and devoured all that the Avvim could produce. When food became scarce, they consumed beasts, the Avvim and finally their own offspring. With time the Nephilim found that they had no comparison under the Heaven and they lost their purpose and the will to rule. Leaving their sons to rule the Avvim, they left the land to find purpose and meaning to their existence.
