The Lilin are the offspring of Lilith, a demoness of primeval times and the Mother of Demons. Lilin appear as winged women with the lower part of a hind. Their appearance is strangely alluring and they seduce and abduct men of weak morals. Regardless of their ancestry, they are of this world and can be summoned without the sacrifice of blood.
