Skeletal legionnaires risen from the ashen fields of Ermor, they are armed with rusty spears and tower shields and wear armor of dried leather and rusty iron. Fearless and skilled in combat, they march upon the living to reclaim their dead empire. They do not rout unless all undead commanders are killed. The longdead are mindless and will quickly dissolve if they are broken on the battlefield.
