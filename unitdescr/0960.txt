Carcator is a pocket lich. In fact, he is the only known existing pocket lich. Several hundred years ago, an unimaginably powerful entity tore off the head of a bothersome lich, shrunk the head and bound the will of the lich to the head. Carcator's head is now the size of a large apple and the magic that binds his will forces him to serve the possessor of his head to the best of his abilities. Carcator has become increasingly grumpy over the years and spits and whispers foul curses at anyone nearby.
