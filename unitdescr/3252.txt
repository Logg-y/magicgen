During the Malediction, evil was let loose in the kingdom. The Hunger that the evil aroused resulted in cannibalism and practices even worse. Some of the warring nobles succumbed and became vampires who thirsted for human blood. Lothar Blumenreuter is one of these cursed nobles. In life he was a scholar and physician of remarkable skill. When the Malediction struck his endeavors turned to madness and he tried to find the place of the soul though vivisection. Now his castle has become a place of utter horror filled with the screams of dying men. Vampire counts can dominate human peasants, who become nearly mindless and serve their master as obediently as dogs.
