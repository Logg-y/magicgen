Rarku, the Hunter of Heroes, is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. The Hunter of Heroes primarily targets well known and mighty heroes as they provide more emotional sustenance than ordinary men. The Hunter has emerged several times in history and slain the mightiest heroes of the time. It has strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack heroes previously marked by Astral magic.
