Manco-Ocllo is the mummy bundle of the first Sun King and his Coya, Manco Capac and Mama Ocllo. When Manco died the last of the Harab Seraphs decided to preserve the remains of his body and his mind and performed the first sacred embalming. Mama Ocllo, his wife, decided that she would give her life to complete her husband's afterlife. The priests were skeptical, but her devotion and magic skills were well known. They complied and she was ritually sacrificed and mummified together with Manco. To ascertain that the ritual would succeed several priests and virgins of the Sun were also sacrificed, expected to become advisors and companions to the couple in the afterlife. The result was a remarkable success, perhaps due to Mama Ocllo's deep magical understanding. Now every Mallqui mummification is performed in accordance with the steps prescribed by Mama Ocllo. Initially Manco-Ocllo presided over almost every mummification in the kingdom, but when the practice became ever more popular, the Hurin priests took charge to allow the royal mummies to enjoy their afterlife without disturbances. Now the First Couple has returned, to lead the kingdom after centuries of silent gatherings and feasts with the dead. Manco-Ocllo is a Mallqui composed of half a dozen component mummies and spirits. It has the ability to cast multiple spells at once and is the most powerful mage-priest of the kingdom.
