The Oppressor Archons are the rulers of Phlegra in all but name. Since the days of the Theurg Tyrant there have been oppressors with greater powers than their peers, but only after the Tyrant's demise were they able to grab power. The Oppressor Archons are skilled mages ordained as high priests. Their magic knowledge is considerable and the iron headbands that gives them command of the communion of the shackled mages gives them almost godlike powers. The Archons rule Phlegra with an iron hand.
