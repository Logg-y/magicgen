The Ilah is a giant of divine heritage. A previous Pantokrator gave him mandate over the desert skies. When jinnun, demons and primordial beasts rebelled against the Pantokrator and attacked mankind the Ilah became a warrior against the wicked. With time mankind began to worship the Ilah as a God. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the Ilah for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Ilah is free to claim the world as his and wage war upon the enemies of man.
