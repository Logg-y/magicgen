Ko-Oni are small, mischievous demons from the wild mountains of Yomi. They are ugly and wild, with staring eyes, unkempt red hair and pot-bellies. They have clawed feet, fangs and porcine faces. Most Oni dress in tigerskins and wield clubs. Oni are demons and don't need to eat. However, they have tremendous appetites and like to eat and their human servants are often left starving if food is scarce. Oni are almost immortal. If their body is slain, their spirit will survive. If the spirit is not slain or banished as well, it will reform a new body over time. Their residual spirit form is a ghost and can be banished.
