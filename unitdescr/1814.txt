The Fir Bolg are the descendants of the Nemedians, a proud race that once warred with the Fomorian giants and were forced to leave the land. The Fir Bolg returned to Fomoria ages later and accepted Fomorian rule. They spread and multiplied and conquered lands of their own far beyond the Fomorian heartland. But then came the Tuatha. The Tuatha were also descendants of the Nemedians, but their power was greater by far. With enchanted spears and spellsongs they quickly conquered the lands of the Fir Bolg and settled on a magic isle. Now the Fir Bolg serve as farmers and lowly warriors of both Fomorians and Tuatha. They are somewhat larger than humans and have long lifespans, but they have lost or forgotten much of their Nemedian legacy. Fir Bolg use armaments made from bronze and leather.
