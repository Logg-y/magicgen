Kurofumi is an ancient sorcerer and practitioner of dark magic. He has traveled into Yomi and entered the Underworld on several occasions and is reputed to be the one who brought the demons into this world. Kurofumi encourages the Oni wars and planned the Oni conquest from the palaces of the Oni Kings. With the Oni Kings occupied in this world, he plans to rise to power in the Underworld and become a ruler of the dark lands. Kurofumi is the Master of the Shadow Blossom and anyone hurting him will suffer from blindness. His long exposure to the powers of the Underworld has infused him with demonic strength. He can be banished by priests, a fact he is unaware of.
