While the Tuatha Kings rule and wage war, their consorts use their time to practice the more refined arts of the race. They have mastered the magic of false appearances, mists and the winds. The Tuatha are also closely attuned to the land and are skilled in Nature magic. Poetry is very important to them and the Tuatha have developed remarkable spellsongs.
