Since the devil worship spread in the kingdom the Goetic Masters have bound ever more imps and demon servants. Unfortunately the imps are difficult to control unless magically dominated or given very specific orders. In warfare the problem became even more obvious and the masters decided that they had to train regular captains in demonology and give them infernal words of command, so that the Goetic Masters themselves wouldn't have to join the armies of the kingdom. A Goetic Captain is such an individual, trained by the Goetic Adepts to command the imps and devils the masters have summoned. The training is time consuming, and most of the captains chosen for the task are not magically gifted. A few, however, are blessed by chance or infernal lords, and become Diabolists in their own right.
