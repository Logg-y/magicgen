The black plate infantry of Ulm are clad in full plate armor made from the Blacksteel of Ulm and armed with heavy weapons and tower shields. They are trained to move and fight in heavy armor without tiring. The Blacksteel armor of Ulm is made by the master smiths and their superior craftsmanship is obvious to anyone wearing an Ulmish armor. Both stronger and lighter than ordinary plate armor, they make the soldiers of Ulm superior to any other human infantry. Sure of the superiority of their armaments, the black plate infantry have slightly higher morale then the regular infantry of Ulm. The inhabitants of Ulm are large and can endure much physical punishment before collapsing, but are vulnerable to magic.
