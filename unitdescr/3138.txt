The Elder Cyclops is an exalted giant of ages past. They were once taught the secrets of metalcrafting by the Telkhines. When Telkhinis sunk beneath the waves and its masters were imprisoned in Tartarus, the Elder Cyclopes were spared in return for their services. But the celestial powers forgot about their servants and their crafts were not put to use. The Cyclopes found themselves lost and without purpose. Watching the lesser races they found a kindred race in the Gigantes of Mekone. The few surviving Cyclopes settled in the golden city of Mekone and were given purpose again. With the fall of Mekone the remaining Gigantes and Cyclopes retreated to the burning fields of Phlegra where they settled and built a cyclopean fortress of iron and stone.
