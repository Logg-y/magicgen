In the great cities of Bogarus many magical traditions are flourishing under the protection of the princes. In the palaces of the princes, mages are trying to accomplish one of the oldest goals of mankind: The transmutation of base metals into gold. The alchemists of Bogarus are generally wealthy and serve the princes only when amply paid. Alchemists gain a 50 percent bonus when making gold with alchemy.
