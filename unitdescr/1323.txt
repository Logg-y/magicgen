Nagarajas, Naga Kings, are the rulers of the Jeweled City of Patala. They are skilled generals and powerful mages and priests. They often take the shape of a Gandharva when leading mundane armies. If killed in Gandharva shape, they revert to their serpent form and fight on. Nagarajas in Naga shape have their skill in Water magic increased.
