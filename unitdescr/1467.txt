The Oracles are ancient Pale One mage-priests seated upon thrones in the Halls of the Oracles. They rule the Pale Ones with wisdom and precognitive powers. With the advent of the New God, they have foreseen Agarthan dominance of the surface world and are preparing their subjects for the conquest. In the Halls of the Oracles their perpetual council decides the fate of the world. The Oracles are divided into three orders. The Oracles of Subterranean Fires is the oldest of the orders. Created by Ogon himself, they were instrumental in creating the kingdom and keeping the magma at bay. With the goodwill of Rhuax secured, the Pale Ones were able to make a living in caverns closer to the Roots of the Earth and the Pillar on which Everything Rests.
