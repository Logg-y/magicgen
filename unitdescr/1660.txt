Udum'ukinna was the firstborn son of Ekishnugal, the First King. When the kingdom found itself threatened by the Priest-King Etimmu and his host of shades, Udum'ukinna led the lizard host against the spectral legions with great success. But Udum'ukinna and his generals were surprised by a cowardly sneak-attack by shades in the night. Etimmu, who had learned necromancy from the Sauromancers, was afraid that the Sauromancers would revive the Royal Heir. He dismembered the body of Udum'ukinna and placed his body parts in thirteen secret vaults. But Udum'ukinna had a lover and companion who, torn by grief, traveled to the Shaded Lands and uncovered the body parts of the Prince and reassembled him and gave him back life. But Zilammu failed to find one piece of his body. The Reassembled Prince has no tail. Such was the power of Zilammu's Ritual of Rebirth that Udum'ukinna was not just reborn, but became truly immortal. However, his new body could not harbor love and he and his companion parted ways. Now he appears from time to time to aid his King.
