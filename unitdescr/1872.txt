The Cult of the Solar Bull is one of the many mystery cults that have become common in the late days of the Empire. It is very popular among the soldiers of the Limes and most of its higher members are former soldiers or Centurions. Leo is a title given to a member of the Cult of the Solar Bull. The Lion receives training in solar magic and leads simpler ceremonies. The Leo is gifted with solar inspiration and is partially resistant to fire. Leos command great respect among the soldiers of the Limes, even those who are not members of the Cult. The ritual practices of the Leo lead worshippers astray and can lower the Dominion of the True God. The Leo can be distinguished by his golden plumage and an emblazoned sun on his chest. Leos are often occupied with military matters and are rather poor researchers.
