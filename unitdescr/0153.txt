The Crones of Avalon are the oldest and most powerful Witches of Avalon. Secluded in the Tower of Avalon, they avoid the bickering of lowly lords, but will aid the kingdom and its Master in times of dire need. The Witches of Avalon are skilled in the magic of Nature and Air and can use spellsongs once sung by the Sidhe of Tir na n'Og. They are priestesses of the old ways, but rarely join ceremonies and leave religion mostly to the Mothers of Avalon. Most Crones are incredibly old and few of them would travel far from their sacred forest.
