Enkidus are large, hairy wild men with horns and unkempt hair. They live and frolic with the beasts of the wilderness and have only a vague notion of the concept of civilization. There are three Enkidu tribes. In the swamps lives a tribe known for their foul temper and cruel ways. The Reavers are the elites of the hunter tribe. They collect bones, teeth and other tokens of victory from defeated foes, which are supposed to increase the rage of the Reaver and protect him from malign magic. Reavers, like all hunter Enkidus, are able to go berserk.
