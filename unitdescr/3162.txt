Most of the Trophimoi are human students that come to Phlegra to study ancient lore, but some unscrupulous individuals come to gain personal power over their fellow men. Following the tradition of Phlegyas, the Theurg Tyrant, the Oppressors capture and train promising youngsters in the use of magic. The young mages are shackled with arcane bonds that places them in a forced communion led by the Oppressors. The Oppressors wear iron headbands forged by the Elder Cyclopes that allow them to dominate arcane communions and the Shackled Ones.
