In the deepest parts of the most fearsome swamps there is something that devours everything that dares to enter its domain. This is known as the Ancient Presence. It is very old and grows larger by incorporating the victims that it devours whole as a part of itself. No hero can stand against the Ancient Presence, for it devours and incorporates anyone that gets close and only becomes stronger.
