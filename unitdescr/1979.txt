In the beginning of time, the first humans lived in scattered tribes. But with the influence of supernatural powers, civilization dawned upon mankind. Small kingdoms formed and order was established. These kingdoms and their rulers emerged and disappeared in quick succession. Driven by fear of being dead and forgotten, the kings built tomb palaces to create resting places where they could live on eternally. But with time came dust. The palaces were covered with sand and their memories forgotten. Inside the tombs the ancient kings and their soldiers still live on. Dust Kings have bony, leathery bodies that withstand damage well. They are constantly surrounded by a dry, parching wind. Dust Kings are resistant to fire, but not to cold as most other undead are. They fight with ancient weapons and wear linen armor. They were sacred in life and are sacred in death.
