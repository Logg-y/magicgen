The Matrona of the Healing Spring is a giant of divine heritage placed to guard a spring by a previous Pantokrator. For some reason the spring was special to the Pantokrator and he instilled his power in the sparkling waters. He told the Matrona never to bathe in the sacred waters and to keep them ever clean. But the Matrona of the Spring couldn't resist and bathed in the blessed waters, and the powers instilled in the spring were suffused in her body. And mankind came to her and begged her to heal them from all ills, and they gave her their prayers. But one day the Pantokrator returned to take his centennial bath, and discovered that the reinvigorating powers of the spring was lost and its waters befouled by the filth of men. Furious he threw the Matrona into the spring and placed a cliff on top of it imprisoning her for eternity. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, a trickle of water is eroding the stone. Soon the Matrona of the Healing Spring will once more bring mercy and wisdom to mankind.
