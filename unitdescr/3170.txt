The opulent halls of the Orichalcum Palace are guarded by dogs of gold and silver. The dogs never sleep and are ever vigilant. The dogs of silver are better at finding sneaking spies and assassins while the dogs of gold are stronger and better personal guardians. They both have exceptional senses and can detect even invisible trespassers.
