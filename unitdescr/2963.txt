Since the founding of the Great Temple of the Moon old traditions have become less prominent. The old faith revering the forces of nature is all but forgotten. Not even the Mushussus are considered sacred anymore. But the dragon-kin have always been used in warfare, and regardless of the loss of their sacred status they are still formidable beasts of war. Now they are trained to pull chariots and obey their Enkidu charioteers. Each Mushussu is cared for by a retinue of trainers and caretakers and if the charioteer is killed in battle a new one will replace them after the battle.
