Phlegran Oppressors are mages following the tradition of the Theurg Tyrant. The Oppressors capture and train promising youngsters in the use of magic. The young mages are shackled with arcane bonds that place them in a forced communion led by the Oppressors. The Oppressors wear iron headbands forged by the Cyclope smiths that allow them to dominate arcane communions and the Shackled Ones.
