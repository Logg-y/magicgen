The Oath-Bound are the elite warriors of Vanarus. They are the last of the Vanir and gifted with supernatural abilities. They pledge their lives to their ruler, thus their name. Recently some of the Oath-Bound have left for distant lands to trade and plunder. It is rumored that the emperor of Pythium has employed such a band as bodyguards of unfaltering loyalty. The Oath-Bound are Vanir and can hide their true appearances with illusions and tricks of the mind.
