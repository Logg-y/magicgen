The Titan of Serpents and Healing is a giant of divine heritage. She is the Mother of Serpents and Mistress of the Medical Arts. Her blessings give health and her wrath gives untimely death. In combat she is always accompanied by a handful of snakes, two of which she holds in her hands as weapons to attack her enemies.
