Moss Agate is a member of the Closed Council and one of the most respected Oracles in Agartha. She is sometimes referred to as the Oracle of Subterranean Forests. Ever since her first visit to the forest underneath she has been enamored with growing things. Her interests has brought her far from her cavernous home and she alone among all Oracles has ventured outside to the sun-lit world to learn the mysteries of plants and beasts. Her fame and status grew over time. When Emberstream died after giving birth to the sacred swarm, Ogon the Earth-Blooded gave Moss Agate a seat in the Closed Council. Moss Agate is the youngest member of the Council, but her mysterious powers and knowledge will be invaluable in the conquest of the surface world.
