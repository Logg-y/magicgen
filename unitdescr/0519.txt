Trolls are robust, humanoid creatures with stone-like skin. While most trolls live in caves in the wilderness, there are some that form small kingdoms under the rule of a mighty troll king. These kings are skilled craftsmen and powerful Earth mages. Their craftsmanship is rivaled only by the dwarves of Nidavellir. They don golden armor made in forges in the depths of their mountain halls.
