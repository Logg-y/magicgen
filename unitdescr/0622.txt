Shadhul Ummush is an ancient Atlantian King who foresaw the downfall of the Atlantian kingdom. R'lyeh would conquer and enslave the marine world regardless of his actions and he decided it was better to serve than to die. Thus he chose to betray his brethren in exchange for a position of power in R'lyeh. Shadhul is now the most powerful Water mage in R'lyeh.
