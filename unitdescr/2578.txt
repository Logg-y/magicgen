The Yazad King is one of the last remaining the Yazatas, or 'Adorable Ones'. The Yazatas were semi-divine beings of an earlier age and the ancestors of the Caelians. Their power was broken by the previous Pantokrator and most fled to the Celestial Sphere ages ago. The few remaining Yazatas hid beyond the clouds of the highest mountains and begot offspring known as Caelians. The Yazad King is mage of great power who has taken the role of a Pretender God to lead the Caelians in world conquest. The Yazad is able to project his Fravashi, guardian spirit, in times of need.
