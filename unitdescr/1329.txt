Yakshas are semi-divine beings of the sacred Mount Kailasa. Their time has passed and the most powerful of them have left this world and entered the Celestial Spheres. The few that still linger on are the ones infatuated with the beauty of the wild and the riches of this world. They have bred the monkey people and led them into servitude. Yakshas are gifted with Celestial Splendor that strikes lowly beings with awe. They are sacred to the monkey people. Yakshas are spirits of Nature and are powerful Earth mages.
