Eunuchs are widely used in the Imperial Bureaucracy, because they do not nurture dynastic ambitions. Most eunuchs are administrators, tax collectors and Ministers, but some are given armies to lead. To emphasize the similarities with the Celestial Bureaucracy and thus the legitimacy of the Bureaucracy of T'ien Ch'i, the eunuchs are given jade-colored robes, jade being the color of the Celestial Bureaucracy. They also carry a fly whisk used by those who serve the Ministry.
