The Bandar are large, black apes who tower over their fellow apes and monkeys. Bandar light archers are lowly Bandar, barely above the Vanara in status. They are not given armor nor are they allowed to fight in melee, as this would give them honor and the possibility to climb in the social hierarchy and get noble mates.
