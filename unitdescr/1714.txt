The Dakini is a bloodthirsty apparition of vengeance from the Nether Realms. It is a sky dancer and a divine messenger banished to the Nether Realms in ages past for serving as a divine acolyte of a blood-thirsting Pretender. Dakinis share the appetites of their old mistress and can be summoned by the sacrifice of innocents. Their flaying daggers are enchanted to drain the life of their victims. Dakinis are powerful Blood mages.
