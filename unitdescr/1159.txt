The warrior smiths are the rulers of the tribes of Ulm. Every tribe is led by a chieftain, a shaman and a smith. The chieftain rules in matters of war, the shaman in spiritual matters and the smith in judicial matters. They alone have mastered the Enigma of Steel and they make the weapons and armor used in tribal wars. Smithing has become the equivalent of making a sacrifice to the Lord and no other culture has developed such skill in magical forging. Warrior smiths are skilled in Earth and other Elemental magics.
