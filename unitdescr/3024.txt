The Machimoi are human soldiers of Erytheia. Human citizens have low status and are exempt from most political offices. They are allowed to join the military, but are considered unskilled despite the fact that they trace a legacy from Arcoscephale. The Machimoi are equipped with light arms and serve as skirmishers.
