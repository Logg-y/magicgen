Petraios was once a warleader and commander of a contingent of centaur warriors. A daring raid upon an Ermorian settlement caused a bloody retaliation campaign that lasted for several years. A dedicated Ermorian centurion led his troops into the deeper forests and came across a sacred grove. When Petraios arrived with his centaurs, he found the grove desecrated and the guardian dryad flayed and staked. But hidden under a great cedar tree he found Karya, the daughter of the dryad of the desecrated grove. Petraios brought the young dryad to the Grove of Gaia where she was trained by the Panii. Petraios returned from time to time to watch over her, and soon after she came of age she followed him on his campaigns and adventures. The unusual couple has become quite famous in the forest realm. Their bizarre monogamy has made their reputation grow even further. In battle Petraios fights while Karya casts spells from his back.
