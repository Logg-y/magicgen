'Umm Ghulah, Mother Ghul, is an ancient Ghulah of extraordinary powers. Many a tale of a Ghulah ensnaring, killing and cannibalizing a handsome man is attributed to her. She claims to be the first of her kind and there is no man alive to refute her claims. She once served the Black King, but has since left Ubar to feast upon the flesh of men. Now that the seals of Ubar are weakening, she has decided to return to her former home and offer her services.
