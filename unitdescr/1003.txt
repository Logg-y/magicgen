When the New God came to the scattered Raptor Clans, he reformed the cultic structure of the Raptors. The wisest and most skilled Seraphs were entrusted with the leadership of the cult. When the Lost Clan returned to Caelum, they replaced not only the High Seraphs as leaders, but also the Seraphines as priests of the reformed nation. The Harab Elders are powerful mages of the Winds and the Afterlife. A few of them have been seduced by memories of ancestral ghosts and are once again practicing tainted magic of Fire and Death.
