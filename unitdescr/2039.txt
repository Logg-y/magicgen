The Melqarts, blood-thirsty Rephaite kings of ancient times, were once perceived as sons of the gods. Now their memories have taken that place and the dead kings have become gods in the truest sense. These deified dead are central to the cult of the Rephaim, their legends told to the young and the old. These Malikum have made themselves kings of Sheol, as they once were kings in the land of Hinnom. From their ghastly courts the Malikum answer the call of the Zamzummim to receive life for a life at a banquet for the dead. Accompanied by their Ditanim, they return to lead the Rephaim as incarnate gods.
