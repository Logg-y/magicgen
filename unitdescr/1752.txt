Since the Tuatha failed to conquer Fomoria, they retreated to their Blessed Isle of Tir na n'Og. Only a few of them remained in the old kingdom of the Fir Bolg. The Sidhe are their descendants. The Sidhe now compose most of the nobility of the kingdom. Most of them practice the crafts, poetry and magic of their ancestors on the Blessed Isle, but they also rule the Fir Bolg and command them in battle. Poetry has always been important to the Sidhe and all Sidhe champions are skilled bards and able to use spellsongs.
