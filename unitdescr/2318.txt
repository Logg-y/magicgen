The Celestial Dragon is a primordial dragon put in charge of the heavens by the previous Pantokrator. For millennia he delivered celestial decrees and brought order and celestial punishment to mankind. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, he is free to rule the world in its entirety. In true shape the Dragon King is a serpentine monster with tigers claws and shimmering scales of a carp. It is able to run in the air and swim in the water. It is a master of air and astral magic, but has difficulties mastering other forms of magic. It can take the shape of a celestial dignitary more suited for spellcasting. It loses some of its powers in dragon shape.
