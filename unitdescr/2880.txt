When Therodos was destroyed and the Telkhines slain or imprisoned, Lysagora and her sister was spared. When their father Demonax began to study stygian magic their mother warned him against the dangers, but he would not listen. Makelo tried to find another field of study, but only her daughters followed her example, and the Telkhine kingdom was afflicted first by the Telkhine Malediction and then by divine punishment and utter destruction. When Therodos was swallowed by the sea Makelo disappeared. Lysagora hid beneath the waves in the ruins of the shattered kingdom. But then the ghosts rose and Lysagora found herself worshipped by spectres of the ancient world. Lysagora led the human ghosts and a few scattered sea daimones in an attempt to rebuild Therodos, but then a God awoke and whispered promises of a reborn kingdom returned to its former glory. Lysagora practiced the healing magic of her mother, but she was influenced by her father and did not entirely avoid stygian magic. However, she took no part in the Telkhine Malediction and she doesn't spread poison like her imprisoned kin. Lysagora is a Telkhine and is able to change her shape. In her demonic form she appear with dog head and flippers instead of hands and her powers over storms and the sea are increased. In human shape her skills in forging are increased.
