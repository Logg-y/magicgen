When the ways of man came to the ancient woods, the centaurs were the first to adopt the new ways. As civilization spread, the centaurs forgot the old ways in their attempt to mimic human society. A new class of nobility emerged as the centaurs learned the arts and crafts of men. Curious of the magic of men, centaur sages left their woods in search of other paths of magic. Skilled at research, these sages practice astral magic previously unheard of, but most also have some skills in the ancient paths of the wild.
