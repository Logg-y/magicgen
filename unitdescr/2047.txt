Anak was a Rephaite of prodigal strength and power. His father was Arba, founder of Ashdod, and the first Melqart to turn from the bloody cult of the Nephilim. Anak fathered three sons who became the first of the Anakim. Sheshai was born with the power of the flames and has a furious temper. Ahiman was born with the strength of the mountains and is stronger than his brothers. Talmai was born with the power of the planets and can foresee things that have not yet come to pass. It was through his wisdom that many scriptures were saved from the destruction of Kiriath Sepher.
