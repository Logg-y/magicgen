Bernlad the Green Knight is a reclusive knight of whom little is known. He first appeared at a tournament held at the edge of an old forest. He sat astride a great unicorn and wore a shimmering green armor and claimed to be Bernlad the Green Knight. No one had ever heard of him before the tournament. The Green Knight is not a great commander, but is skilled in combat and has spells woven into his armor. Bernlad regenerates wounds and may heal any battle afflictions he suffers.
