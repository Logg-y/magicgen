When the Zotz emerged from their cavernous realm they found a world divided in four directions. In each cardinal direction guardians had been placed by some great being. The Chaac are powerful warrior spirits of thunder and rain. They have strangely elongated noses and blueish skin. They guard the subjects of the Awakening God with their thunderous might. The Chaac are connected to the four cardinal directions and have corresponding powers. The Red Chaac of the East brings Thunder and life-giving rain to the land of the Lord.
