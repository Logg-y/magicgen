The Witches of Avalon begin their careers as Daughters dressed in white. They are trained by the Mothers and eventually sent to Avalon to serve the Coven. As a Daughter gains knowledge and responsibility, she is given three tests and when she passes them, she becomes a Mother. The Witches of Avalon are skilled in the magic of Nature and can use Spellsongs once sung by the Sidhe of Tir na n'Og. The older Witches also use Air magic.
