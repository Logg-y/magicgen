The Triton race is ancient and Tritons have lived in the oceans since they were created in the image of some ancient god. The first of these Tritons were given exceptional powers and strength by their creator. The blood of these ancients is still strong in the royalty of Pelagia. Once they were sacred priest kings of the kingdom, but now the few remaining Triton Kings have turned their interests inwards and have relinquished their priestly role. Pearl Clan priests perform the ceremonies and practices of old and have replaced the kings as interpreters of the divine will. Triton Kings summon hippocampoi, magical steeds of the deeps. The Triton Kings are unrivaled mages of the path of Water.
