With the coming of the Lawgiver, the religious structure of Mictlan was altered. Blood sacrifices have been abolished and the Sky, abode of the Lawgiver, has received a new and important role. From the skies He observes the actions of the Mictlan people and judges them accordingly. In the skies His two faces, the Sun and the Moon, smile upon the righteous and give them strength of heart and prophetic dreams. From the skies falls the life-giving Rain and from the skies comes harsh judgment in the form of thunder. The Sky Priests serve as judges of the provinces. They travel the land and mete out justice and guide the locals. They are trained in Air magic, but a few of them have studied the other manifestations of the God. Sky Priests have a bonus when patrolling provinces.
