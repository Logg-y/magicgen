Monks are the most common clerics of Man. Living in the numerous monasteries of the kingdom, they pray and copy the holy Scriptures. Their work as scribes and illuminators has been noted by the witches of Avalon and now the monks are tasked with copying the ancient texts of the Tuatha as well as religious texts. In this way monks can aid researchers if there is a lab in the province. The Monks are sometimes sent into battle to bless soldiers and pray for the dead. They have somewhat limited powers, but are very inexpensive.
