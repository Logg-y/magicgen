Thunder Priests are the religious leaders of the tribal moiety. They command the weather, storms and the wild woods. While not as influential as the Perkunu they are respected by humans and Chudes alike. The life of a Thunder Priest is permeated by taboos regarding settlements and cooked food. Thus Thunder Priests rarely venture into settled areas save for special occasions such as marriages or times of war.
