The Gelatinous Cube is a strange entity created from water and vitriol. The vitriolic water is given form and purpose through powerful alchemical rituals. The entity slowly slides forward and swallows anything it passes over. Swallowed beings quickly dissolve in the vitriol, unless the cube is destroyed and its magic unraveled.
