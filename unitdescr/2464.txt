The Neter is a giant of divine heritage. A previous Pantokrator gave him power knowledge the moon and the stars and the wisdom how to use it. As guardian of the celestial bodies he observed what was, what had been, and what would come to pass. During the rebellion of the lesser gods, he observed but did not interfere on either side. For this the Pantokrator imprisoned him for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone his astral prison is weakening and he will return to guide the world as he wills.
