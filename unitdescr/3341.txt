Na'Ba is ruled by Malikat, Jiniri Queens descendant of the Sultans of Old Ubar. Their blood is pure and runs thick with the magic of the Jinnun. Their bodies are insubstantial, almost transparent and ever young. They are gifted with flight and are innately skilled in the magic of the Jinnun. They can obfuscate their surroundings and hide their entire entourage with illusions and tricks of the mind. Like their ancestors they suffer pain if touched by cold iron. From the palaces of Jannah the Malikat rule over the men and giants of Na'Ba, and send caravans of marvelous wonder to distant lands to gather riches and knowledge to aid the Awakening God.
