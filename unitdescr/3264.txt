In the enchanted forests of Mount Shinuyama live animals gifted with supernatural longevity and magic abilities. When an animal gets older and wiser it becomes increasingly more powerful. The Okami is a magical wolf of Shinuyama gifted with longevity and magical strength. Many Okami are benevolent and they sometimes follow travelers and protect them from harm. The Okami is attuned to magic and its powers are greater where magic is strong.
