Inquisitors are priests responsible for the eradication of false faiths. They command large armies and administer hunts for heretics and heathens. Inquisitors receive some training in the House of Justice to learn the art of interrogation with Fire. With the destruction of Ermor the inquisitors found their influence diminishing and devil-worship spreading. To remain in power they reorganized the state cult and institutionalized the devil-worship. Devils became regarded as instruments of the faith, serving the House of Justice. But they are not to be worshipped outside the liturgy of the church. The inquisitors travel the land to ensure that no devil gets adoration other than on Devils-day.

Inquisitors are especially good at suppressing enemy Dominion and unrest.
