The Titan is a giant sprung from the forehead of a previous Pantokrator, when he had a thought he couldn't contain. Fully grown and armed, she burst forth and claimed divinity. She was eternally imprisoned for her impudence of giving the Pantokrator a headache. Her origin as a thought has made her wise and prudent. Her shield is painted with a Gorgoneion that strikes fear into the hearts of men. She is at all times followed by her owl companion.
