The Bitch Queen is a werewolf enchantress of tremendous magical power. The Bitch Queen usually appears in the form of an old hag, but when angered, she transforms into a werewolf. Even though her werewolf form is more powerful than her human form, it is still quite weak when compared to the majority of the other Pretender Gods. Whenever she goes into battle, wolves will come to her aid.
