When the Humanbred population was granted freedom, at first they were only allowed lowly positions in the society, but with growing influence came demands for positions of power. Now pureblooded Abysians are rare and Humanbreds are allowed to become priests. In order to keep the higher priestly ranks restricted, a new priestly caste called the Anathemant Newts was formed. These are Humanbred Fire priests of limited power. The Newts have grown in number and now compose much of the Abysian clergy.
