Caelos is the Commander of the Temple Guard. He gave up his wings after losing his Iceclads in a battle against infidels. The event ignited his religious fervor and he has since fought harder and braver than any of the Storm Generals against the enemies of the faith. He was recently promoted to the status of commander. His fanaticism has given him priestly training otherwise restricted to women.
