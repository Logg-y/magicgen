Sometimes the Olms of the deeper earth are summoned by Agarthan mages. Once they were allies of the Oracles, but after the arrival of men they have returned to sequestration and must be coerced by magic to aid the rulers of Agartha. They are skilled mages of water and are considered sacred to the Pale Ones, although they are not trained as priests. Olm Sages have some oracular powers similar to that of the earth readers, but they draw their insights from other sources.
