Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land. Halfmen, like humans, have underwater counterparts. Ichtycentaurs appear as centaurs with fish tails instead of hind legs. They are wild beings that roam the kelp forests of shallow waters, not unlike the centaurs that roam the woodlands on dry land. Ichtycentaurs have strange abilities of transformation and can remove their tails to walk on dry land.
