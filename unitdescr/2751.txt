The Wayob are Zotz sorcerers. Through contact with the Nahualli of Mictlan they have learned new forms of magic and have turned to the forces of nature and the wild forests in search for power. Here they have mastered the art of shape shifting and can take the shape of ferocious jaguars when wounded. The Wayob were unable to master the Nahualli magic of the stars, but compensate this with the Zotz's affinity for blood magic. When the caves dried up the Wayob returned with the other Zotz and are now more common then the Ah Itz sorcerers.
