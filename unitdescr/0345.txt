The gnome is an old creature of Earth and Nature. Gnomes appear as small, gnarled old men with bright, red caps. They usually live in forests or vales far from civilization, where they tend the flora and fauna of the region. Gnomes use illusions to hide themselves and are therefore difficult to find.
