The Imperial footmen are skilled and heavily armed, but quite slow. To stifle internal unrest and protect administrators in times of civil disorder, the Bureaucracy needed faster soldiers that were quickly deployable and skilled at crowd control. Ministry guardsmen are medium elite infantry that accompanies eunuchs and Ministers on their less popular missions. Their training and loyalty is almost as good as that of the Imperial soldiers and they are good at patrolling.
