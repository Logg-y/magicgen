Horrors are astral beings that feed on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. They have strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack creatures previously marked by Astral magic. Horrors sometimes appear in highly magical countries to attack people who have been marked by evil Astral mages.
