The oldest and most powerful Aboleths are called Mind Lords. They have tremendous magical and mental powers and are able to dominate lesser beings with a mere glance. They have shed the last of their dark scales and are pale and soft, but large enough not to fear anything less than an asp turtle. The Mind Lords are formidable mages of Water and the stars and have recently taken a greater interest in the Stellar Sphere. Merman stargazers who are able to leave the sea are trained in Astral magic to study a newly discovered star of auspicious importance.
