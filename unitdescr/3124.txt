The Titan of Forethought is a giant of divine heritage. Once beloved of a previous Pantokrator he was tasked with guiding mankind to prosperity and wisdom. But he began to love his protectees more than he loved his master and he stole the fire and gave it to mankind, and then civilization, medicine, astronomy and navigation. With rising ire the Pantokrator saw mankind worship the servant instead of his master. He demanded his servant to teach mankind how to sacrifice meat to their true master, but the Titan tricked his master and taught men to keep the best meat in the sacrifices and leave the bones smeared in fat for the Pantokrator. Furious the Lord of All punished men with awareness of their inevitable downfall, but the Titan of Forethought robbed them of foresight and hope returned to mankind. Finally the Pantokrator shackled his servant to a rock and sent a great vulture to daily feed on the liver of his former servant. Now with the disappearance of the Pantokrator the Titan of Forethought have returned to thwart those who claim Dominion over this world.
