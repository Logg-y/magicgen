The Bacabob are ancient Atlantians and descendants of the Basalt Kings who came with the flood. With the failed attempt to conquer the sun-lit world they withdrew to the safety of the flooded city and went into torpor. When the caverns dried up and the Zotz returned their priests disturbed the depths. The Bacabob awoke from their centennial slumber to claim dominion over Xibalba. They craft the enchanted obsidian used by the sacred warriors of the kingdom and lead the Chilan cult of the caves. The Bacabob are masters of subterranean waters and are worshiped as water-divinities by Zotz and surface-dwelling men.
