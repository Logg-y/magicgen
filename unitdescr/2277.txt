Geryon is one of the Demon Lords. He takes the form of a great wyvern with the paws of a lion and the head of an elderly honest man. Geryon is the monster of fraud and all souls who cheat and commit fraud are his to claim. His mere presence cause turmoil and disorder as honest people become selfish and untrustworthy.
