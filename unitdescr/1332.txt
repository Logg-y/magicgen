Apsaras are divine nymphs that have left this world ages ago. They serve the Celestial Gods as untiring dancers and singers. They are sometimes summoned by the calls of the monkey people living on the sacred mountain where the worlds lie closer. Apsaras are blessed with an Aura of Splendor that strikes mortals with awe.
