The caste of Anathemants are led by exalted Fire mages known as Dragons. These sacral mages administer the processions, ceremonies and sacrifices in the Temple of the All-Consuming Flame. They are revered and feared by all Abysians except the Warlocks of Smouldercone. Anathemant Dragons are Abysians and radiate the hellish heat characteristic of their race.
