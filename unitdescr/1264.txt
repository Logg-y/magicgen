Ao-Oni are short, green-skinned demons from the snow-covered mountains of Yomi. They are ugly and wild, with staring eyes, unkempt red hair and pot-bellies. They have clawed feet, fangs and porcine faces. Ao-oni dress in tigerskins and wield clubs. Ao-oni, like most Oni, are minor magicians and can project the cold of their mountain on enemies within reach. Oni are demons and don't need to eat. However, they have tremendous appetites and like to eat and their human servants are often left starving if food is scarce. Oni are almost immortal. If their body is slain, their spirit will survive. If the spirit is not slain or banished as well, it will reform a new body over time. Their residual spirit form is a ghost and can be banished.
