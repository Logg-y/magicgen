The Nushi is a swamp spirit. It has the appearance of a withered old crone, but takes the appearance of a beautiful woman when in the company of men. When it strikes, it reverts to the crone form and claws her attackers. All Nushi can change shape into serpents if threatened. The Nushi is attuned to her home and will gradually wither and die if she leaves her swamp.
