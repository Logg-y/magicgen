The queen is the wife-sister of the king. Together with her king she rules over land and over sea. She is queen and high priestess, general and grand sorceress. She rules every aspect of her kingdom and soon the world. To preserve purity of blood and prevent threats to the ruling dynasty, the kings and queens of Erytheia marry their sisters, sons and daughters. The king and queen share power and rule every aspect of the kingdom together, including the royal cult. They are considered divine and are the highest ranking priests of the kingdom. When a princess is crowned queen she is inaugurated as high priestess as well. Should the current queen die, the king marries one of his sisters or daughters and they share power until one of them dies. The surviving monarch then marries another sibling or one of their offspring.
There is fierce competition among the royal siblings and most queens occasionally execute their sisters on claims of conspiracy.
