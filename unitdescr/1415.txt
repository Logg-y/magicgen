While the Triton mages of the Pearl Clan are the most skilled mages in Pelagia, there are numerous other mages of lesser power that serve the Pearl Kings. It is not uncommon for mermen to study the secrets of Thaumas and their ability to enter dry land has made them useful now that the Pearl Kings look upon the Closed Realm with new-kindled interest. Mermages sometimes develop skills in earth magic that is otherwise rare in Pelagia.
