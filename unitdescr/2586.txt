When the Abysians first conquered Tur, they defeated a small army of War Elephants. Impressed by the size and effectiveness of the elephants, the Turans adopted the use of elephants and now they are as important as the regular cavalry of the nation. The Elephants form the main shock contingent, while the Savaran cavalry are used to outflank the enemy army.
