The Daeva of the Bloody Mace is an angel of destruction emanated from the Angra Mainyu. During the reign of a previous Pantokrator, the Daevas rebelled and started a war against the Ahuras and the benevolent Mainyus. The Daeva of the Bloody Mace became the eternal enemy of the Ahura of the Oath. But when the Pantokrator tired of the war among gods, he imprisoned or banished Ahura and Daeva alike. Now with the Pantokrator gone and his prison crumbling, the Great Daeva is once more able to bring strife and destruction to this world.
