Huacas, 'sacred ones', were semi-divine beings of an earlier age and the ancestors of the Nazcans. Their power was broken by the previous Pantokrator and most fled to the Celestial Sphere ages ago. A few of them remained in this world but were gradually turned to stone. The Stone Huaca is one of these petrified Huacas that has become a shrine and a place of worship for the Nazcan people. Once among the most powerful of the Huacas the Petrified One is now breaking free from the Pantokrator's curse and ready to lead the Nazcan people to world domination.
