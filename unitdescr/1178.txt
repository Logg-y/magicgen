The Androphags are ruled by Witch Kings skilled in dark sorcery. The Witch Kings rule by strength and harsh justice. Those who oppose them are swiftly killed. They are formidable warriors and it is said that the blood of serpents flows in their veins. The Witch Kings have unnaturally long lives and few remember how they first rose to power. Most likely their strength and sorcery is a gift from supernatural forces. The Witch Kings introduced cannibalism and manflaying to the Sauromatian people. Feeding on one's fallen enemies is only practiced by the Androphags, but manflaying is a widely accepted practice in all of Sauromatia. The Witch Kings use flayed-skin standards and wear skullface masks. They are truly horrible to behold.
