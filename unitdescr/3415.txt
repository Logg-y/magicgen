After the success of using wolves in battle, some Vaettir wanted to improve that strategy by using a larger animal. And what could be better than using the largest animal in the forest, the moose? With some help from the Gygjas, some Vaettir managed to befriend the huge animals. The moose proved to be a most fierce beast in battle and the Vaettir could do no more than try to remain on its back when it attacked the enemies. To solve this problem, the moose riders are equipped with bows so they can fire, at least when the moose is stationary.
