When Therodos was destroyed and the Telkhines slain or imprisoned, Dexithea and her sister was spared. When their father Demonax began to study stygian magic their mother warned him against the dangers, but he would not listen. Makelo tried to find another field of study, but only her daughters followed her example, and the Telkhine kingdom was afflicted first by the Telkhine Malediction and then by divine punishment and utter destruction. When Therodos was swallowed by the sea Makelo disappeared. Dexithea tried to save the remaining Daktyloi and Hekaterides and settled on a shattered isle where the old traditions were preserved. But then the ghosts rose and Dexithea found herself worshipped by spectres of the shattered kingdom. Dexithea led the human ghosts and a few scattered sea daimones in an attempt to rebuild Therodos, but then a God awoke and whispered promises of a reborn kingdom returned to its former glory. Dexithea never studied the stygian magic of her father, nor did she practice fiery magic. Instead she excelled at the healing magic of her mother and she taught some of her arts to the Hekaterides. She took no part in the Telkhine Malediction and she doesn't spread poison like her imprisoned kin. Dexithea is a Telkhine and is able to change her shape. In her demonic form she appear with dog head and flippers instead of hands and her powers over storms and the sea are increased. In human shape her skills in forging are increased.
