When the Atlantians of the Forsaken Coast finally returned to their ancient home in the deeps they were greeted by a few surviving Atlantians. Mages and Mothers of the Deep had survived the invasion from the fallen star by returning to the ruined basalt cities of an earlier era. Here they had gathered strength and power from the source whence they once came. In the basalt depths they found the means to withstand the mind shattering dreams of the great enemy. The Merciful Mother is an old shambler priestess who has survived the fall of Atlantis and accepted the returning Angakut and their iceclad servants. Under the tutelage of Mother Hydra, the Merciful Mothers have mastered the means to fight the dreams of R'lyeh. They have given up sleep and their minds are strengthened through rigorous mental training. They are now ready to lead the returning Atlantians as the Coral Queens once did.
