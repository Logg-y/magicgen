The tribe of Benjamin is a very small tribe. After a treasonous act they found themselves attacked by most of the other tribes and were systematically slaughtered. Only a few of them survived due to the intervention of the lords of Gath. The Benjaminites are known for their skill as slingers, but also for training to fight with both hands. They use the colors of all the tribes, but are more commonly associated with the image of the scavenging wolf. Benjaminites receive a bonus when pillaging.
