The Tuatha are the ancient masters of Tir na n'Og and Avalon. When men came to their lands, they retreated to the Land of the Ever Young and were lost to the world. A few of them lingered on and aided the retreat of their Sidhe descendants into strange and magical twilight lands hidden under ancient mounds. With the coming of the new God, a few of them have returned from their seclusion together with their Sidhe descendants. The Tuatha are powerful Air mages and can use glamour and illusions to hide their true appearance.
