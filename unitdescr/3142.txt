The Younger Cyclopes are known for their exceptional Mouflon sheep. They are almost as large as horses and they have thick luxurious furs. The Mouflon are quite aggressive when protecting their young and can be herded towards enemies in battles. The Mouflon are brought along to feed the Phlegran armies or patrol the lands.
