When the Atlantians fled into the deep swamps and jungles of Mictlan, they found a people that worshipped the Rain as one aspect of their God. Here, they found a place as sacred beings of the Rain and the swamp. The Atlantians are few in number and most are trained as sacred warriors or priests in the Rain Cult. The Atlantians dream of an eventual return to their former home beneath the sea and the amphibious Rain Warriors will lead the first wave.
