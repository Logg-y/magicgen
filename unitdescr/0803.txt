Celestial Masters are high Masters of the Way who have accepted title and training in the Celestial City. Skilled in magic and esoteric arts, they have been revered and respected as religious leaders since the birth of the Empire. Celestial Masters are the highest ranking priests of T'ien Ch'i, but since the founding of the Bureaucracy and the institutionalization of the faith, the Ministry of Rituals has reduced their religious influence. They are still revered and respected among the people of the Empire, but most of the important ceremonies are now performed by the Ministry. Celestial Masters are versatile mages adept in Water magic. They once practiced Fire magic, but the founding of the Bureaucracy has led them to studies of Earth magic. The Element of the Earth is stable and a more suitable magical foundation for an Empire than the wild nature of Fire magic. As high Masters of the Way, Celestial Masters have perfected the art of internal alchemy and have gained longevity.
