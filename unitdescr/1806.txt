It was long since that the last Fomorian left the land of Eriu, but their legacy still remains. Every now and then a baby is born with Fomorian blood in his veins. They are destined to become heroes and are trained to become great warrior poets. They join the band of the Fianna and are respected throughout Eriu. They use broad swords and heavy iron armor. The Fianna are sacred.
