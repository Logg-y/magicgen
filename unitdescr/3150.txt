When Eurymedon, King of the Gigantes, led his kin to war against the gods of men, his son Nausithous saw the folly of his ways and fled with a few followers to distant lands. Eventually the Gigantes settled on Black Korkyra in the phaeacian archipelago. After a short conflict the Gigantes yielded and Nausithous offered himself in marriage to the Colossi Queen. The Gigantes of Black Korkyra still fight in dense hoplite formations. Only a few of the gleaming armors crafted by the Elder Cyclopes in ancient times have survived so the Gigantes of Phaeacia use regular spears and plate cuirasses.
