The Sastar is a commander of the Spire Horn Caelians. Most Sastars are promoted from the ranks of the Tempest Warriors and they are sometimes called Tempest Lords. Like their Kavi ancestors they are able to fly even during heavy storms. Their training and bronze armor give them increased resistance to lightning. Sastars use ice blades forged by the Airyas.
