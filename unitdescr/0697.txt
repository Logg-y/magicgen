When the ways of man came to the ancient woods, the halfmen initially refused to adopt the new ways. But as it became clear that well-trained, disciplined and armored troops would defeat huge armies of wild satyrs, bronze cuirasses were forged and given to satyrs trained in battle. Satyr hoplites became the core unit of the Pangaean armies. With greater exposure to the civilization of man came the skills of ironworking. In this New Era, the bronze armor of old has been replaced by cheaper and stronger armor of steel.
