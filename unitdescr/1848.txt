Klaus left Ulm when his master, one of the few remaining sorcerers, was caught by the emerging Iron Inquisition. He traveled far and wide and visited many courts of the time, where he mastered the art of diplomacy. When he heard rumors of the opulent halls and magical riches of Agartha, he decided to make them his. Agartha was a broken nation in need of guidance and he felt a need to guide them. By gathering mages who had fled the Iron Inquisition and with economic aid from the Emerald Emperor of Pythium, he organized the human conquest of the cavern realm of Agartha. He orchestrated the reforming of Agarthan society and created the Golem Cult for his fugitive mages. He made himself a power behind the Oracles and rules the Golem Crafters with iron hand and silver tongue. He alone among the humans remembers how the Cult was formed and how the Oracles accepted human worship. Klaus now serves the Emerging God, certain that it will further his interests and power. Klaus is a skilled diplomat and spy, should he care to venture outside his opulent chambers. He is also a most skilled mage-smith and Golem Crafter. Blessed by some unknown fate, he has lived far beyond a normal human lifespan, but old age is starting to take its toll on him.
