The Annunaki is a giant of divine heritage. She was once banished to the Underworld by a previous Pantokrator so that she would prevent the dead from returning. There she claimed rulership of the dead and her beastly hounds hunted down those who tried to escape her shaded lands. Now with the Pantokrator gone, she is free to once more return to the land of the living. Her command is death and her intent is to put the world in darkness. Her servants from the underworld has followed her to the world of the living to hunt for living prey.
