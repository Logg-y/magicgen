In the deserts of Na'Ba, reclusive sorcerers practice the ancient magic of the Hinn and the Jinn. The Hinn and the Jinn were spiritual beings of air and fire that roamed the land in times before mankind came to dominate the world. Many Sahara have made pacts with the Hinn and have Hinn companions. While most of these hermits avoid contact with other men, there are some who follow their tribal leaders and join their caravans to guide them and protect them from supernatural threats.
