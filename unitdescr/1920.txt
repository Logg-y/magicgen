The Skoptsy, or Castrated Ones, are the cult leaders of the Khlysty. To be able to communicate with the Awakening God, they have performed the first seal on themselves, the removal of the fruits of sin. This means having his testes, or in the case of a woman, her breasts, removed. The Skoptsy are stealthy and cause unrest like the Khlysty. They lead the bloody ceremonies of the Khlysty and some of them even go as far as to dabble in Blood magic to prove the might of the Awakening God.
