Zennyo Ryuo is the dragon of Ryuketsu Mountain. She once lived in a pond in the palace of the bakemono kings, bringing rain and prosperity to the land. But she was banished when a prominent guest to the bakemono court was found drowned in her pond. Due to her long service to the bakemono kings she was granted a secluded cave where she has since hidden. Being a dragon she has powers over rain and rivers and her nature occasionally causes rain storms and floods to the countryside near her cave.
