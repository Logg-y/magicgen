The Imperial City Guard protects the Celestial City. They use heavy armor and have the superior training of Imperial soldiers. Armed with polearms and possessed of unfaltering loyalty, they are given the thankless task of crowd control. Each City Guard counts as three ordinary soldiers when patrolling.
