Gygjas are Jotun sorceresses and practitioners of the dark art of Seith. Once they served the Niefel Jarls with guidance and sorcery, but when the last of the frost giants disappeared the oldest and most powerful of the Gygjas withdrew into the Iron Wood and sequestered themselves. The remaining Gygjas and their descendants turned to the Jotun Jarls and now use Seith to give them advice once given to the Niefel Jarls. The Gygjas of this age have lost some of their former powers and only the ancient hags of the Iron Wood compare to the Gygjas of old.
