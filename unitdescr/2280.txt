The Illearth is an earth elemental that has been summoned by sacrificial blood. The elemental is corrupted by the blood used in the summoning. Elementals are projections of raw elemental power given life through strong magic. All elementals shrink in size and power when severely damaged. Illearths can withstand tremendous amounts of damage and they regenerate wounds even faster than pure earth elementals.
