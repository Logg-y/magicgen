The Magnificent kingdom of Ind has armies of brave and righteous men, but it is not they who wage the wars of the kingdom. Instead it is the heathen cannibal tribes subjugated by the Prester King who in times of war are unleashed upon the world. So bereft of culture and virtue are these heathens that when one of their numbers die his friends will stop to gobble him up without cooking him. This they believe will cleanse them from sin. Most cannibal tribes use spears and javelins.
