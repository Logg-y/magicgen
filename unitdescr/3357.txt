The Mukarrib, One Close to God, is an 'Adite priest. The priests of Na'Ba are divided into two sects, those who regard the Godhood as ascending from the earth, and those who regard the Godhood as descending from the stars. Most of the 'Adite population of Na'Ba worship the astral aspect of the Reawakening God and their priests observe the signs of the stars. The 'Adite Mukarribs reside in the cliff cities and are closer to power then the human Karibs. While less numerous than the human priests, they have far greater influence and religious authority. To most effects they even outrank the Jann Nobles, who care little for religious affairs, besides being worshiped.
