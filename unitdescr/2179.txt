In the center of the First City lies an enormous temple ground. Here priests and sacred warriors are trained. The Sal-Me is a priestess and temple-consort at the House of Waters. Her most important role is as a vessel for the divine principle of fertility. In sacred marriage rites she blesses and brings fertility to the land.
