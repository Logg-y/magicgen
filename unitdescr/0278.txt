Jotun spearmen are giants armed with spear and round shield. They wear heavy armors and helmets. Giants are tremendously strong and large, but size can be a problem when several smaller enemies gang up on one giant. The giants of Jotunheim are stronger and tougher than most giants and their ancestry make them almost impervious to cold. Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning bolts.
