Since the Malediction, the Iron Order has become increasingly more influential in Ulm. Fear of the unknown is common and religion is perceived as the only comfort available. Since its early days, the Iron Order has grown in influence and power. The Black Priests have replaced the smiths as master artisans and mages. They alone are allowed to practice magic, for magic outside religion is sacrilegious. Now the smiths are long since gone. The last ones were hunted down and put to the stake by the Iron Inquisition installed by the Black Priests.
