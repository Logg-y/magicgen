Arch Devils are the lords of the fiery Inferno. Winged and powerful, they lead the Infernal armies. They are mighty users of Fire magic. Arch Devils radiate heat and are themselves impervious to heat and flames, but they are susceptible to cold and frost. There are only five known Arch Devils. Magoth is weaker than the other Arch Devils, but he is skilled in Astral magic.
