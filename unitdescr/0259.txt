Lictors were once Ermorian dignitaries entrusted with keeping the peace during the heyday of the Empire and now they are reanimated by the Dusk Elders and Spectators of Ermor to uphold the order of their re-emerging Empire. Lictors are equipped with rusty plate hauberks and the great axes formerly used as a sign of their office. A Lictor can only be reanimated with the use of strong magic. They are so closely connected with the Netherworld that they are surrounded by a wind of numbing cold. Lictors are corporeal undead with dried, leathery flesh that can withstand much damage. The reanimation ritual keeps their minds somewhat intact, which means that Lictors are not unbreakable.
