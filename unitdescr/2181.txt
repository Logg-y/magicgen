The First City of Eridu is ruled by priest-kings. The Ensi leads the lesser priests and ensures the prosperity of the kingdom. Once every year he participates in the sacred marriage ritual together with his consort the Entu, the priestess-queen. Their joining ensures the fertility and prosperity of the whole kingdom.
