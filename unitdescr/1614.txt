The Toad Tribes are not of human stock, but of the same race as the Atlantians. Most likely they left the deeps for a life in the swamps in the distant past. Tribal peoples of the wild follow their shamans and totemic spirits. The shamans of the Toad Tribes have skill in Water magic and occasionally in Nature magic as well.
