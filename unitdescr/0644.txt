The Dracolich is a Dragon that was once highly skilled in Death magic. When it died, its power over Death saved it from becoming permanently dead. Ever since, it has managed to stay alive in a state of undeath. The shape of the Dracolich is not suited for spell casting. They have their skills reduced when casting spells from paths other than Death. Therefore, it tends to adopt the shape of a Bog Mummy in battle.
