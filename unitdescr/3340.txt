The Sahir is a Jann Sorceror. The Jann are half-breed descendants of the Jinnun of Ubar and all the Jann are innately skilled in the magic of the Jinnun. They are indisputably powerful wielders of Fire and Air magic, but they also trace a legacy to the magic of the Watchers brought by the Avvites of 'Ad, including the reading of auspicious Signs. Unlike the Jinnun of Ubar the Jann have physical forms and are visible, but they can hide their true appearances and are able to fool lesser men with illusions and tricks of the mind.
