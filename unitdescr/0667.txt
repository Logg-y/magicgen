The Praetorian Guard serve as the bodyguards of the Thaumaturgs. The Guard consists of old veterans given the honor when they left their old careers. The members of the Praetorian Guard are all very skilled and brave, but their age makes them weak and many have old wounds that have never healed. They wear heavy plate armor and are armed with broadswords.
