Since the Angakut learned the techniques of ice crafting from Caelian captives, enchanted ice has been used to craft armor and weapons. Atlantians of the Frozen Seas are resistant to cold and can comfortably wear ice armor. Ice warriors are heavy infantry equipped with ice hauberks, ice lances and ice aegis shields. The ice hauberk tempers and hardens in cold climates.
