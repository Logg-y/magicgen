In the caves of the God Mountain, cultic assassins are trained by the Black Sorcerers. The Bane Spider is a fully trained assassin and a master of melee combat. They wear black plate armor and wield magical Bane Blades that cause the flesh of anyone hit to fester and rot within moments. Bane Spiders sometimes lead Spider Warriors.
