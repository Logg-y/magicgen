Lu Tung-Pin is one of the Immortals, the ancient heroes of T'ien Ch'i who have attained a limited form of divinity. Lu Tung-Pin became an Immortal when he was given a sip of wine by a mysterious old man. He fell asleep and had many a strange dream. When he awoke, he sequestered himself and lived as a hermit until he had perfected the arts of swordsmanship and internal alchemy. He is armed with an enchanted Demon Slayer sword given to him by a Dragon. He also wields an annoying Fly Whisk.
