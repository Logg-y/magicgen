The Patriarch is the highest ranking priest of the Empire. Bartholomeus was trained as a Theurg in the Cathedral of the Spheres and after years of manipulating and assassinating his chief rivals, he has been elected by the Emerald Council to take the Holy Seat. Now he commands the vast power of the Theurg communion.
