The Asynja is a female Aesir who has survived the death of her kin. The Aesir were ancient gods who were defeated aeons ago by the Rimtursar in a cataclysmic battle. The Asynja was once given the task of guarding the apples of immortality by a previous Pantokrator, but she was abducted by a descendant of the Rimtursar and lost the apples. The Pantokrator punished her with eternal imprisonment. Now with the disappearance of the Pantokrator she has returned to bring hope and life to the world.
