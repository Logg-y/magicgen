At the dawn of time, on the sacred mount Hermon, descended six angels in full celestial splendor to the natives of the holy land to aid and instruct them in righteousness and wisdom. The Avvim were a people strong and beautiful of mind and body. They were adept students and their culture flourished under the tutelage of the Watchers. But before long the Grigori became enamored with the Avvim, shared their burdens and taught them things that should not be taught. Tempted by the beauty of the Avvim, they took their daughters as wives and sinned before the Celestial Powers. Their offspring were the Nephilim, giants of great power, abominable to the world. When the Celestial Powers lashed out in fury, the Grigori were banished to the infernal realms where they still linger, fettered by bonds of iron tempered in the blood and tears of those dead by their gifts of civilization. Azazel was the leader of the Watchers and the first one to sin. He convinced Semyaza to join him and then the rest of them and they swore a pact that they would all commit to sin. Azazel taught the Avvim how to make war, how to make weapons and how to make and use cosmetics. He is a formidable warrior capable of seducing those who are weak of will.
