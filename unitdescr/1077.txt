The Myrmidons are the elites of the Golden Era. A philosopher once commented that their heavy bronze armor made the Myrmidons resemble ants, hence their name. The Myrmidons themselves claim that the founders of their band were actually ants transformed into thickly armored soldiers of great strength. Myrmidons wield short swords and carry shields.
