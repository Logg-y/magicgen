Ether Warriors are members of a race of large, humanoid beings that were banished from this world in ancient times. Their wars drained the world of Arcana and they were forced to enter other realms of existence in order to continue their clan wars. The lesser races and their gods sealed the astral gates behind the Ether Warriors to ensure the safety of the world. Ether Warriors are powerful beings and can live for centuries unless slain in battle. All members of the race are ethereal and very difficult to harm with non-magical weapons. Ether Warriors use Moon Blades, magical swords that cause additional damage to magical beings. Ether Warriors are magical beings and cannot be commanded by mere mortals.
