With the growing power of R'lyeh, the Deep Seers warned the Kings of the Deep of the growing danger. Few of the Kings would listen and thus Atlantis perished. But there were a few who had heeded the warning and searched for a refuge, should the Coral Towers fall. At a frozen coast littered with bones, the Kings of the Deep struck a pact with the Awakening God of the Forsaken Coast. They swore to become priests of that emerging God and in return, the God would lead them back into the sea. A new culture formed and the Kings of the Deep became priest-mages, Angakut, of the Frozen Seas. The Angakut are powerful mages of Water and Death magic. Their powers over the Frozen Sea lets them craft cities and vessels of ice and they can bring armies with them across the oceans.
