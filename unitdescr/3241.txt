Perkuna Tete was born during a devastating thunder storm. Her mother hid underneath an oak tree and was struck by lightning, but she miraculously survived, became pregnant and gave birth before the storm had passed. Her mother took her to the Perkunus who said that the girl was divine and twice blessed by Thunder and Oak. Perkuna Tete was raised in the tribal moiety under the tutelage of the Perkunu. When she climbed a mountain to pass her final test roiling storm clouds gathered in anticipation. But when lightning struck her, her heritage became manifest and she was transformed into an oak. For a full night the tree that was a woman was hammered by lightning. Morning come the storm receded and the tree became a woman once more. Her unconscious body was recovered and placed underneath an ancient oak where she lay unmoving until spring brought life to her slumbering body. Perkuna Tete is considered the most able and wise among all thunder priests.
