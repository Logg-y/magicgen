The Fomorian King is a king of the giants who once guarded the realm of the watery dead. Under their rule the Fomorians emerged from the depths and sailed to distant shores to plunder and ravage the land with plague and gale. Punished for their sins, the Fomorians were banished and forced to find a new home. The Fomorian Kings are powerful storm crafters and Death mages. They protected their land from the invading Partholonians and their descendants with plagues and further doomed their race. Fomorian Kings are cursed with a monstrous appearance and have only one eye. They are formidable shipwrights and can enter the ocean realms.
