Skögu was born in the swamps of Pythia ages ago. His mother left him in the swamps to die, but he was found and nurtured by a Pythian serpent. When he returned to his tribe, he could still not speak a word. He was not accepted and wandered the land until he came to a strange island and met a beautiful enchantress. She took him as her lover and taught him three languages that are spoken today, three languages that are dead and finally the language spoken by the dead. She must have loved or hated him greatly, because she also taught him the dark art of necromancy. When the witch finally got tired of her young lover and banished him from the island, Skögu was maddened by rage and turned his dark arts to practice. He returned to his tribe with a host of ghosts and slew and ate those who opposed him. He sacrificed women as he would his former lover, should they meet again, and made his tribe do the same and he made his tribesmen eat those they defeated in combat. Soon the Horror of the Androphags spread across the steppes. He took seven wives, three living, three old and one no longer living. The sons of his wives were taught the dark arts and he called them Witch Kings. Skögu has since retired into the swamps of Pythia where he feasts upon the flesh of men, awaiting the arrival of his former lover. Skögu rides a Pythian serpent reanimated by vile magic.
