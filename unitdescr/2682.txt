The Wayob are Zotz sorcerers that have fled the flooded caves of Xibalba. Through contact with the Nahualli of Mictlan they have learned new forms of magic and have turned to the forces of nature and the wild forests in search for power. Here they have mastered the art of shape shifting and can take the shape of ferocious jaguars when wounded. The Wayob were unable to master the Nahualli magic of the stars, but compensate this with the Zotz's affinity for blood magic. When the Muuch emerged from the flooded caves the Wayob were curious. When the forest dwelling Zotz and the brown Muuch allied themselves, the Wayob were approached by the Bacabob and they agreed to aid the kings of Xibalba. Now they give advice to the surface-dwelling chieftains of the kingdom.
