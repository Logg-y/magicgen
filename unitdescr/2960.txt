The Apkallu is a celestial sage and servant of a previous Pantokrator. Gifted with the knowledge of the Spheres he was tasked with bringing wisdom and civilization to the world. But the Apkallu failed his mission. He brought the gifts of civilization to the Enkidus and the hairy men built their first city. Instead of spreading his wisdom and lore to the entire world the Apkallu favored the Enkidus and in return they started to worship him. When the Pantokrator discovered the treacherous actions of the Apkallu, the great sage was imprisoned for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Enkidus call his name once more, and his prison is crumbling. The Apkallu carries a milullu cone and a medical bucket with which he can cure diseases.
