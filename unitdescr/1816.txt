Fomorians are a race of malicious and deformed giants descended from the cursed Fomorian giants. Many of them suffer from afflictions such as limps and missing eyes. Almost all are cursed with goatlike heads. Warriors and champions among the Fomorians are often taken from the clans where the Curse is weaker and fewer members suffer from the afflictions typical of their kin.
