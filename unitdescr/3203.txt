The Titan of the Hunt is a giant of divine heritage born at the dawn of time times. She became a huntress of primordial beasts and was entrusted by a previous Pantokrator to care for the wilderness. He gave her a golden bow and authority over the animals of the wild. But mankind began to make offerings to the Huntress and she let herself be worshiped and promised mankind that she would protect the huntsmen and the unmarried women of the world. The Pantokrator sent his servants to punish her for her breach of trust, but she transformed herself into a deer and escaped into the First Forest. Here she met another of the Pantokrator's servants and he gave her hounds to aid her in the Hunt. The Pantokrator was furious and trapped them both in the forest for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the paths of the First Forest are once more open and the Titan of the Hunt can once more hear the prayers of young women and huntsmen. With primordial monsters emerging anew the Titan of the Hunt has taken it upon herself to rid the world of monsters and claim the world as hers. The Titan of the Hunt is always accompanied by her sacred hounds, as well as animals of the wild.
