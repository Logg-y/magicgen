The Hun Came, One Death, is a giant of divine heritage once placed in charge of the beginning of the cycle of death by a previous Pantokrator. He would cause death and lamentation to the world. He saw that everything in the world would come under his reign sooner or later, but this was not entirely true. Dominion over the cycle of death was shared with his brother Vucub Came, Seven Death. He was given the end of the cycle by the Pantokrator. Hun Came came to realize that his brother represented the end of Hun Came's authority and he became jealous. The One Death shared his powers with nine lieutenants, the Bolon-ti-ku, the Nine-Gods, and with their aid he slew his brother and ended the cycle of death and rebirth. With the breach of the natural order set up by the Pantokrator the world became depopulated, wild and inhospitable. The world was plunged into darkness and the dead threatened to replace the living. The Pantokrator became furious and punished his rebellious servant with eternal imprisonment. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the prison of the Hun Came is weakening and the world might once more be plunged in Darkness.
