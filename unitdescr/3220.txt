The Oppressors scour the countryside for gifted youngsters. Lured with false promises they are brought to the laboratories of the Oppressors, where they are shackled and put to stressful training in the magical arts. Most of them only lose their minds or important body parts in the process, but a few actually develop some magical understanding. Given arcane collars forged by the Cyclope Smiths, these Shackled Mages are joined in a forced communion dominated by the Oppressors. The Shackled ones are usually forced to do research for their masters, but sometimes they are brought forth to aid their Oppressors in combat.
