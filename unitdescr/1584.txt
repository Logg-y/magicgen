Warenheris is the great-grandson of Athalwolf, the Maker of Heroes. His father, Hrodric, died protecting Warenheris' mother from an Ermorian Senator. Athalwolf was led to believe that his granddaughter and Hrodric were both killed and retreated into seclusion. When Warenheris was twelve years old, he left his home in search for his great-grandfather. When the two finally met, Athalwolf left his seclusion and summoned seven ancestor spirits, including the ghost of Hrodric, to teach Warenheris the art of Steel. Warenheris is now the most skilled warrior in Ulm and has become a living legend. His strength and battle prowess are formidable and the warrior smiths have given him an enchanted sword of sharpness.
