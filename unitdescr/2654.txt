The Apu is a Nazcan captain. All higher commanders of the Sun Kingdom come from the noble class, expecting mummification and an afterlife of comfort and reverence. When an Apu dies his body will be retrieved and brought back to Nazca where he will be embalmed in a bundle wrapped in cloth and leather, together with jewelry and riches.
