Cornelius is the current Pontifex Maximus and the highest ranking priest of the Old Faith. He was the one who performed the high sacrifices in the capital. But it was also he who let decadence and corruption thrive in the priestly order. He has been blamed by many for the fall of the Old Cult and its traditions. The Arch Bishops of the New Faith let him remain as a figurehead, but everyone knows that his influence is limited. Cornelius still commands great religious authority and is a potent mage. Cornelius is old, frail and rather fat and rarely ventures far from his chambers.
