Corix is one of the oldest and most respected members of the Gathering. His position made him chief negotiator when the Ermorian legions arrived. Under the white flag of truce he approached an Ermorian Centurion who, upon hearing that Corix was a Druid, demanded to know what the future held for him. Corix regarded the Centurion and with sad voice prophesied his untimely death. In furious anger the Centurion incarcerated the Druid and blinded him. When his Legatus Legionis found out, he was promptly executed and Corix was released and returned home with a treaty of peace. Despite his lack of eyesight, Corix travels far and wide to give his advice to Vergobrets and Chieftains alike. Corix covers his eyes with a red cloth to spare onlookers his grisly appearance.
