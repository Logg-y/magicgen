The Hata Runa are commoners serving in the armies of Nazca. Like militia in other kingdoms they lack extensive training and are rarely used in large scale campaigns. Most commoners in Nazca are owned by or indebted to a mummy bundle and there are few ways to be relieved of the debt other than joining the army.
