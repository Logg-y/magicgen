Mother Hydra, the Once and Future Queen, is the last remaining Basalt Queen. She has slept for millennia under the pale light of a crystal shard. Recently her slumber was disturbed by eerie dreams. Rudely awakened, she emerged from her millennial slumber, never to sleep again. Mother Hydra is now traveling from ruin to ruin gathering her flock and teaching them how to resist the urge to sleep. With the sudden arrival of the Atlantians of the Forsaken Coast, her power and teaching has become instrumental in the conquest of the dream-ridden seas. Mother Hydra has slept for a thousand years. She need not sleep anymore. Her sleep under the crystal shard has prepared her for the dream war and she will not let herself be dominated by dreams or magical coercion.
