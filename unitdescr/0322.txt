With the demise of the Basalt Kings, the Mages of the Deep could seize power. With the Basalt City abandoned, they created the Coral Towers and called themselves Kings of the Deep. These ancient Atlantians have studied the secrets of the depths for ages in the Coral Towers and some of them even remember the secrets of the Basalt City. They excel at Water magic and are often proficient in other magic paths as well. The King of the Deep is able to grant others the ability breathe water and can safely lead a handful of landlubbers into the sea.
