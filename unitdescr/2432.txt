En Hedu'anna is the High Priestess of the Moon. She was born as the sister of the Ensi to be, and was given scholarly training at the House of Water. She turned out to be a willful young lady, and she soon left the temple to travel near and far. When she returned she had learned the arts of mathematics and astrology and her brother, through a clever political move, built a new temple and created a priestly office to suit her skills. She now ranks as high as the Entu-queen, but her body is the property of the Moon himself, and her sacred marriage is ritually postponed every lunar eclipse in waiting for the moon to descend. En Hedu'anna's influence is greater than that of any previous Entu. She is hailed as the first poet and she has composed many of the temple hymns sung at the great temple compound in Eridu. She has brought mathematics and astrology to the kingdom and is respected as a great scientist. Her enemies claim that she learned her skills from Kokabel, Grigori of the Constellations. En Hedu'anna herself claims that the Moon has invested her with his power.
