While most Airyas skilled in magic are trained as Magi, the priest-mages of Ragha, there are a few families who keep the old forms of magic alive. They form a caste of powerful mages, influential in the courts of the Airya Shahs. The Seraphs are powerful mages of wind and ice, but some have learned the Turan ways of Death and Blood as well. The Seraphs can only be recruited in cold provinces.
