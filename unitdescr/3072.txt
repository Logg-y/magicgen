The Kami of the Sun is the daughter of the previous Pantokrator. Together with her two brothers she was brought into existence when the Pantokrator grieved after banishing his wife to the netherworld. When he wiped his left eye a divine spark was set free and hastened to the heavens. Watching the spark he called it daughter. She reminded him of his banished wife and he endowed her with the brilliance and beauty of the sun. But when the people of the world started to worship her instead of him he got jealous and imprisoned her in a cave for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Kami of the Sun is returning to the world to bring joy and prosperity to mankind.
