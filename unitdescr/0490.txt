Jinnun are spiritual beings born from Smokeless Flame in a distant past. They replaced the Hinn and Binn during the reign of a previous Pantokrator. They are naturally invisible and ethereal, but can take physical form when they wish to interact with men. Al Khazim was a Jinn of great renown, but he was trapped in a magical lamp and placed under a curse that will let the lamp be recreated by mere mortals should it be destroyed.
