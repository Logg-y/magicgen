When the Airyas arrived Tur was a stratified society. Families of hereditary priest-mages known as Magi had much influence in the kingdom. The Airya Seraphs adopted the Turan traditions and made themselves Magi of the Airyas. Now there are Magi families of both peoples and the stratification permeates the kingdom. The Zaotar is an Airya High Magus skilled in the traditional magic of the Airya.  The Zaotar and the Dastur share power and influence in the courts of the Shahs. The two priestly orders despise each other and bickering and plotting for power is common in the courts. For a Shah to be inaugurated, a High Magus must be present and the two orders compete for the right to perform the rituals of inaugurating a Shah to office.
