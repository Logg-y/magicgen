Kabti'ili is a shaman of ancient pedigree. He fled from his brother's jaws when he was a hatchling and disappeared into the marsh. He was found and raised by a Couatl, a mysterious sacred serpent of the swamp. After the completion of the Couatl's training, he returned to his tribe and defended them against the Taskmasters of C'tis. One night, he received a revelation from the Great Lord of C'tis. He led his brethren to the Temple Marsh and swore the Lizard Kings his fealty.
