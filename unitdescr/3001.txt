The most prominent families of the Chudes claim to be descendants of the gods and the Sun herself. Chud women of divine heritage are called Daughters of the Sun, Saules Meita, and they are gifted with the magical powers of the Sun. While the Daughters of the Sun are able leaders endowed with priestly powers they often leave religious leadership to the Sons of Heaven. Instead they hone their arcane skills and bring their wisdom to the Hall of the Dawn.
