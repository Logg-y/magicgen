The six great Daevas are divine demons and emanations of the Destructive Spirit. Each Daeva of the Heptad represents an aspect of their Lord, opposed to the Amesha Spentas of the Lord of Wisdom. Nanghaithya is the Daeva of Discontent. She is opposed to Spenta Armaiti, Spenta of the Earth and principle of devotion. Nanghaithya will spread unrest where she dwells.
