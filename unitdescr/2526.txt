In the deep caverns of the earth strange worms and crawling beasts can be found. The Cave Grubs are huge larvae with highly corrosive saliva able to dig through the earth and stone of the under-earth. Their tunnels are used by the Pale ones and other cave dwellers. Cave Grubs have weak minds and are easy to control and compel with magic. Agarthan mages often summon them to dig tunnels throughout their kingdom, but the Grubs' tunneling abilities have other uses and they have been summoned to be used in sieges by surface-dwellers who have found their way down into the under-earth. Ktonian Alchemists have found their saliva to be a highly useful substance and it is an important ingredient when Cave Fire is manufactured.
