Cynocephalians are dog-headed beast-men living in the mountains between Kailasa and the Sauromatian steppes. While most cynocephalians wear hides, the chieftains and the rich wear linen clothing bought from the few brave merchants who traverse their lands. They sometimes raid neighboring lands, but have never fielded an organized army, nor has there ever been a cynocephalian kingdom. Cynocephalian chieftains are not very good commanders.
