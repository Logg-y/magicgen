Angerboda, the Great Hag of the Iron Wood, is the oldest and most wicked of all giants. Her evil nature has turned her home into a forest of iron and ice. Her children are monsters born in the dark of the night. Angerboda has performed Blood magic and necromancy for centuries and has taught her evil ways to the Skrattis of Jotunheim. The Gygjas are her servants and they help her divine the past, the present and the future. She has seen the impending arrival of the Illwinter and has come to aid the Awakening God.
