The Neter is a giant of divine heritage. He was once given power over the desert, storms, darkness and destruction by a previous Pantokrator. Endowed with unequaled destructive power and jealous ambition, he led the lesser gods in rebellion against his master and slew and dismembered him. However, the Pantokrator was reassembled by one of his servants and was able to return from the dead to banish the Neter for eternity. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator, the prison weakens and the Neter of Chaos can once more claim the world as his to destroy.
