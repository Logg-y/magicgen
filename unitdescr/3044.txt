Out of necessity the ruling dynasty of Erytheia has adopted a practice of sibling marriages. The princesses are trained in all aspects of governance, magic and priesthood from a young age. Only when they are married do they end their studies. Should the current queen die, the king marries one of his sisters or daughters and they share power until one of them dies. The surviving monarch then marries another sibling or one of their offspring. Some of the royalty have shown signs of insanity and physical deformities. Most mystics claim that this is the workings of a malign force awakening in the deep and propose a conquest of the shattered lands of Old Pelagia.
There is fierce competition among the royal siblings and princesses occasionally murder one of their sisters to advance their position.
