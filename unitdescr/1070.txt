The people of Arcoscephale have always been a brooding kind. In hidden caves, mystics sequester themselves to search for hidden truths. In cities, philosophers gather and speculate about the origins of the world, its morals and the fabric of the universe. Some philosophers delve into the mysteries of the Arcana and form hypothetical spell designs that are later tested by the mystics. Philosophers can research even though they do not have any magical skill.
