The Gigantes of Mekone consider themselves superior to all. Their Hoplites are of incomparable might and they have challenged the gods themselves. Mekone is a martial society, where combat prowess and strength are the primary virtues. Trade and lesser crafts are condemned as unworthy to the Gigantes and human slaves and servants make up most of the menial work force. The Gigantes are trained from a young age to become formidable warriors armed with gleaming weapons forged by the Elder Cyclopes. The hoplites don heavy armors of gleaming bronze and fight in dense formations.
