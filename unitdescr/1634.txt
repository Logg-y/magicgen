Sialuk is a Kivigtok, someone who has fled civilization for a solitary life in the wild and acquired supernatural powers. Sialuk was once a famous Arssartut. In a military campaign against a raiding army of Caelian Iceclads, his whole company was surprised and slaughtered. He awoke beneath the corpses of his fellow Arssartut and returned in shame. An ancient Angakok called him a coward and traitor and Sialuk left for the wild. He has occasionally been seen by seal hunters, but has avoided contact until now. One day the Angakok who had scorned Sialuk died mysteriously and soon thereafter, Sialuk returned astride a Tupilak monstrosity. Sialuk has now been given command over the Arssartut.
