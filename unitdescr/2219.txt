Forest trolls are somewhat smaller than normal trolls, though still very large and strong. The forest trolls are known for their cunning and grow moss on their skin. This helps protect them from fire which is so frequently used to deal with trolls. Most forest trolls live deep in the forests and avoid contact with men. Forest trolls can survive on a diet of sticks and stones, just like normal trolls.
