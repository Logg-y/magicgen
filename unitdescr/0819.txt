The Heliophagi are the Lords of the Abyss. They are composed of solid darkness except for their golden claws and horns. They have the ability to become invisible in shadows and they are horrible to behold. There are only four known Heliophagi and they are all skilled in Blood magic. Gorilon is also a master of dark magic and can summon bone devils.
