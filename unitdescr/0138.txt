The Gorgon is a female beast of horrific appearance. Her hair is a mass of snakes and her eyes burn with amber fire. Great flapping bat wings grow from her shoulders. The mere sight of a Gorgon is enough to petrify weak beings. The Gorgon is not as magically versatile as the Arch Mage, but more than makes up for it in physical combat ability.
