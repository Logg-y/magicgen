The Bandar are large, black apes who tower over their fellow apes and monkeys. The color of their caste is red, the color of blood and war. The Bandar are the warrior caste and although few in number, command much influence. The king and nobility are always Bandar. The axe is a weapon only used by the nobility. Unlike the sword, it is not a noble weapon in and of itself, but with it comes the power to execute, a power of the nobility.
