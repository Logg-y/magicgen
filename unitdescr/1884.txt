Topiltzin is a Couatl of great renown and remarkable powers. Since the days of the Blood Cult of the Smoking Mirror, he has prophesied about the arrival of the Lawgiver and refuted the foul practices of the Mictlan priests, sometimes emerging from the forests to interrupt important sacrifices. Now, with the defeat of the Smoking Mirror, he has been crowned king and upon his inauguration proclaimed the Age of the Lawgiver. His power and rage against the Blood Cult has led some to believe he is actually the Lawgiver.
