Chuzrael was one of the first Demonbreds created in the Smouldercone. Initially, the Demonbreds were not entrusted with magical training and were instead used as Slayers. The life of a Slayer is short and it soon became evident that the Demonbreds' skills and magical aptitude were better suited for other uses. Chuzrael is the last surviving Demonbred Slayer. He has lived for ages and has mastered the craft of assassination. Chuzrael's demonic ancestry makes him very difficult to detect. His demonic nature is also made manifest in his appetite. Chuzrael reputedly feeds on the hearts of his victims after slaying them.
