The Allfather is the first and the last of the Aesir, ancient gods that died in the great war with the Rimtursar. When the war ended the Pantokrator banished the remaining Aesir from the world. With the Pantokrator gone the Allfather has returned to the world to claim it as his. The Allfather was the foremost of the Aesir and is a master of magic, a great skald and an outstanding general. Like his subjects, he is a master of illusions and false appearances and is able to pass undetected through enemy lands. Like the Vanjarls of Vanheim, the Allfather is able to cross the oceans by ship. The Allfather is at all times accompanied by two great wolves and his great eight-legged horse who is able to ride the winds.
