Heavy cavalry are among the most expensive and powerful units available. The use of a horse reduces the encumbrance of heavy armor and provides the unit with great speed and flexibility. Most heavy cavalry use lances to make a shock charge that can break most enemy units. The horses are trained not to panic and to use their hooves to strike down enemies.
