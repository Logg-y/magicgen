The Pearl Clan was the smallest and most secretive of the Triton clans. Most of them are small and lacking in martial skills, but some are blessed by the Lord and grow large and brave. These are trained in the temples of coral and pearls and are given spears and shields made of mother of pearl. The Pearl Guard are sacred and often follow and guard the priests and kings of Pelagia.
