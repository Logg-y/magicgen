A Bog Mummy is the corpse of an ancient, evil Skratti, or giant mage, who was powerful enough to cheat death. To prevent this evil mage from returning after his death, a long forgotten hero staked him in a bog. But this only helped preserve the body until the bog dried up and some careless farmer pulled the stake loose. Now the mage has returned as an immortal Bog Mummy. Should the Bog Mummy be killed, it will eventually reform in the bog where it was once staked. Being immortal, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood.
