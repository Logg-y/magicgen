The Capricorn is a beast of change and transition. It is an Oceanian half-man with the upper part of a Pan and the lower part of a fish. Capricorns can transform and leave the deeps in the same way as ichtysatyrs. They are powerful mages of the Underwater Wild, but they are also mages of change and transition. Their powers change as they cross the borders of the sea. On land their powers over the earth are increased, while their powers over water decreases. Capricorns are closely attuned to the changing shores and cost less to recruit in lands of turmoil.
