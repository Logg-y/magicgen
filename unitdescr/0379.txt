Niklatu is the most famous Lizard Lord in C'tis. His rainbow armor and comely appearance are enough to make female lizards lay eggs on the spot. Niklatu has performed a number of heroic deeds, including saving the Arch Hierodule from a corrupt and evil Sauromancer who wanted to mate with the Sacred One. The Arch Hierodule granted Niklatu his rainbow armor, a sword of swiftness and the command of the Swamp Guard. To serve under Niklatu is a great honor and soldiers fighting by his side are inspired to great deeds.
