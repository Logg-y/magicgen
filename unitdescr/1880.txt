Throughout the empire, mystery cults have spread and flourished with the influx of foreign culture. One of these, the Serpent Cult, has replaced the official state cult of the Theurgs, but many others ply their trade in secret. The Cult of Revelry is influenced by Pangaea worship and orgiastic hedonism. The Reveler is a high ranking member of the cult and an organizer of orgies in the wild. The Cult of Revelry has proven to be remarkably destructive to the faith of the populace, and no other mystic is as detrimental to the worship of the True God. He wears a garland and carries a goblet of wine. Revelers are generally looked upon with distaste and fear and some rumors claim that they practice cannibalism and blood sacrifices in their orgies.
