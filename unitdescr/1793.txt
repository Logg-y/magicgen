Macha is the mistress of the dark spires of Rath Chimbaith. She is the Queen of the Nemedians and granddaughter of Great Macha, the First Queen. In the seven spires she has initiated numerous sorceresses and kept the legacy of Great Macha alive. Her whisper is a breeze, her voice a gale and her kiss the silent death. She commands the dead and rules the living. She might be the most powerful magician in all of Fomoria and her word is heeded by Nemedians and Fomorians alike.
