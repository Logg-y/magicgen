The Daktyloi are a race of dwarven daimones from the sunken kingdom of Therodos. They were once servants of the Telkhines and were taught their secrets of metalcrafting. Since the Telkhines rarely concerned themselves with lesser beings, the Daktyloi were the ones that brought crafts and metalworking to the human population of Therodos. Their skills in wonder working are almost unequaled and they were considered sacred even in the time of the Telkhines. When the cataclysm hit Therodos they survived on the shattered islands that remained of ancient Therodos. Now the ghosts of the former inhabitants view them as semi-divine carriers of the Telkhine legacy.
