The Melqart is a Rephaite king of a city. Once the Rephaim all lived in Hinnom, but when the Berytians founded colonies near the city of Ashdod, they were influenced by Rephaites and began to worship the Rephaite kings as gods. Now most Berytian colonies have a great temple to a Melqart god, praying for its eventual arrival. The Melqarts are huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers. They have been taught all kinds of secrets by their fathers and are born with magical powers. They are descendants of Azazel and share his gifts. The Melqarts have gruesome appetites and feast on the flesh of men.
