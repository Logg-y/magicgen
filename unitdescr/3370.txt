The Ilahat is a giant of divine heritage. A previous Pantokrator took her as his wife and gave her mandate to rule the world. When mankind began to worship her as well, the Pantokrator he was furious, imprisoned her for eternity and punished mankind with labor and strife. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Ilahat is free to once more rule the world.
