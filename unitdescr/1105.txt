The Triarii are the last defence of the legionary army and form the third rank of the formation. They are handpicked old veterans trusted not to rout. They are given heavy plate armor and long spears and fight in dense formations. The Triarii have great morale, but they are older and weaker than most soldiers in the Legions.
