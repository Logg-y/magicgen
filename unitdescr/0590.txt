Vanlade is an ancient Vanadrott who remembers the time when humans were few and the Vanir were numerous. He is one of the first of his kind and he has studied magic under the tutelage of the ancient god that gave flight to the Valkyries. During his reign Vanheim and the Jotuns clashed and fought over the Oak of Ages, but the jealousy of Sigrdriva, his former lover, turned his attentions away from the giants. His war with Helheim eventually threatened to end the reign of the Vanir. Only with utmost sacrifices did the Vanir stop the onslaught of the giants. Vanlade has led his subjects in hundreds of military campaigns and his reputation as a warrior and sorcerer is widespread.
