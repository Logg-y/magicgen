The Oppressors were the ones who enslaved human mages with magical shackles. When the slave soldiers were given better armaments and the Phlegran armies grew, the Oppressors saw the need for new leadership. The Cyclope commanders, regardless of their claims, were not very good strategists. Some Oppressors made themselves captains and generals of the slave soldiers. Being used to dominating the shackled mages they observed a lack in loyalty among their soldiers. With the aid of the Cyclope Smiths a new form of shackles were forged and the first Iron Bound were chosen. Oppressor Generals are Oppressor mages that have chosen a martial career. They are superior to the Cyclope Commanders, but can only command human soldiers.
