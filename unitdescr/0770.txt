Ram's Head is a white satyr blessed with ram's horns, a sure sign of divine attention. He was trained as a hoplite, but his extraordinary talents soon became evident. Ram's Head is now the most skilled general in Pangaea and his satyr hoplites are fanatically devoted. Ram's Head is sacred, as are most white halfmen. He possesses an aura of Divine Grace and few dare to strike him.
