The Kamadhenu is a spirit of plenty drawn forth during the churning of the ocean of milk. Given divine powers by a previous Pantokrator, she gave birth to all bovine lifeforms and brought plenty to the land. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator, the Kamadhenu has gained freedom and has donned the mantle of God itself. It has the appearance of a great winged cow with the head and breasts of a human female with milk-white skin. Her beauty and peacock tail strike onlookers with awe. The Kamadhenu is physically powerful and attuned to the protective powers of Nature and the Astral Spheres. The Kamadhenu produces milk enough to feed one hundred men.
