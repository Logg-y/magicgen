Alcyonaeus is called the Greatest of the Gigantes, blessed by their progenitor with the Gift of Immortality. As long as he remains in the lands of the exalted he cannot die. When his brother Porphyrion founded Mekone, he got jealous and left for distant lands. Far away from the golden city he made himself king over mortal men and called his land Pallene. For centuries men suffered under his tyranny, but with the recent emergence of the God-slayer Alcyonaus has abandoned his kingdom and returned to his kin in Mekone to lead the Gigantes against the false gods of men.
