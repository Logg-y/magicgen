During the reign of an earlier Pantokrator there was a war among gods. When the false gods and their pantheons were defeated the Pantokrator bound them in the only vessels capable of holding god-spirits, the bodies of dead titans. The titan bodies were entombed at the Roots of the Earth and the tomb was sealed with the aid of a young and innocent race with pure souls, the Pale Ones. With their sacrifice the prison was eternally sealed and peace returned to the world. The few remaining Pale Ones were given the task of guarding the Chamber of the Seal and they have kept vigil ever since. Now the Seal is broken by misguided Oracles and the Imprisoned Ones have returned, bound to the flesh of the God Vessels. The God Vessel is tremendously powerful and will wreak havoc on the world unless destroyed or imprisoned once more.
