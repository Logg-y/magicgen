The Titan of Growth is a giant of divine heritage born in primordial times. She was once given powers over all things growing by a previous Pantokrator. Her blessings and gifts to mankind were numerous and she brought fertility and life to the world. When her daughter was abducted by the Great Adversary she was devastated and abandoned her tasks and all life withered and died. The Pantokrator was furious, imprisoned her for eternity and gave the dominion of growth to a better suited candidate. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Titan of Growth can return to the world and reclaim her former glory and possibly find her missing daughter.
