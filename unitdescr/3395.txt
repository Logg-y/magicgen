The Demiurge is a great serpent created at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It is the progeny of the daughter of a previous Pantokrator. Her misguided attempt at creation resulted in a primordial monster wreathed in divine splendour. The monstrous serpent beheld the world and all its inferior beings. Full of unbridled pride he roared towards the sky and claimed to be the One True God and creator of everything, unaware of the Pantokrator and the true order of the world. The Pantokrator decided to rid the world of the False God and imprisoned him for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Blind God is slowly awakening, free to once more claim the world as his to rule.
