A juggernaut is a colossal structure made out of religious idols and two pairs of enormous wheels. The machine is powered by Astral magic and requires magical leadership. A construction like this has to be almost as holy as the God himself and will rightfully spread the Dominion of its God just like a Prophet. The juggernaut is covered by a layer of gold to make it look even more religiously important.
