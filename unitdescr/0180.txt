A Demilich is an Arch Mage adept in Death magic that has outgrown his need for a physical body. The only things remaining of his old body are a skull and a few bones. It is through these that the Demilich can still affect this world. Should the skull be destroyed, a new one will form shortly after and the Demilich will be able to affect the world again. Being so powerful, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood. The Demilich is very magically powerful and difficult to destroy, but lacking a body he is unable to move between provinces through means other than magic rituals.
