The Bandar are large, black apes who tower over their fellow apes and monkeys. The color of their caste is red, the color of blood and war. The Bandar are the warrior caste and although few in number, command much influence. The king and nobility are always Bandar. The bow is a common weapon, but most Bandar prefer to let the Vanara do the shooting, as the honor and prestige gained from melee is generally higher. Still, an ape with reputation as a great archer can get position and mates of some stature.
