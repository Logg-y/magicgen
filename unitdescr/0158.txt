The Oracle is a powerful spirit that inhabits a sacred spring. The spirit possesses a girl to serve as its instrument. The chosen child is blinded and rendered unable to do anything but speak the will of the spirit. At the age of thirteen, she is sacrificed and replaced with a new girl, born the day the previous girl was made the voice of the spirit. The Oracle is immobile and cannot leave the spring it inhabits. It can possess willing targets to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The Oracle is tremendously strong in its Dominion and magically powerful. The spring can be destroyed, but not easily.
