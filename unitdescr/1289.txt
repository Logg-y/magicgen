The ice temples and Seraphines are guarded by fanatical Airya soldiers who have given up the ability to fly. By cutting off their wings, they lose the freedom so highly valued in Caelian society and commit themselves to serving their God and Master. The loss of wings grants them greater agility on the ground and lets them fight in dense formations. The Temple Guards don icicle mail that magically tempers with colder climate. Their ice blades are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
