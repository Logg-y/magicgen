In the deepest reaches of Agartha lies an ancient chamber sealed by ancient magic. According to Agarthan lore, the Chamber contains three imprisoned gods of an earlier age. Umbrals lurk in the deep cavern halls close to the prison. Umbrals are shadow beings resembling ancient Pale Ones with elongated faces and drooling mouths. Agarthan legends claim that they are the souls of those who sacrificed themselves to Seal the Chamber. The disturbing fact that the Umbrals have become more numerous has led some to believe that the Seal is weakening. Umbrals are ethereal, undead beings capable of draining life from the living.
