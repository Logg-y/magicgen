Murmur is the oldest lizard in the Empoisoners' Guild. He has lived for more than a century and will probably live for another. His skin is stained from alchemical substances that have spilled from ancient clay vessels. Murmur was one of the most successful Empoisoners the Guild has produced and is rumored to have slain hundreds. Murmur has learned the magic arts of Death and Nature outside the old halls of the Sauromancers. He is viewed with suspicion and fear, but his services are sorely needed nonetheless.
