The Arelim are manifestations of the divine powers of the Celestial Sphere. They appear as beautiful winged beings. They are the most gentle of all beings of the Celestial Sphere. They nurture nature and are protectors of the weak. They weep for the wounded and follow armies in lamentation of the wars brought by the gifts of the Watchers.
