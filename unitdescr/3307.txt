The Magnificent Kingdom of Ind has many subservient lands. Among them is Great Orionde, a forest kingdom ruled by noble men who have tamed the wild forests and their inhabitants. Although Great Orionde fields great armies of knights and crossbowmen, it is the half-men and beasts of the land that attracts the attention of visitors. Strange beings with the lower parts of horses or goats are displayed for laughs at the towns and taverns of the kingdom. But these half-men are also used as warriors in the armies levied by the kings of Orionde to serve at the Prester King's pleasure.
