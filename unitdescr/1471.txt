In dark caverns under the Roots of the Earth a strange race of one-eyed humanoids has evolved. Untouched by the sun, they have become known to humans as the Pale Ones. Pale Ones are gifted with perfect darkvision and gills. They inhabit underwater rivers and lakes as well as cavern halls. With the coming of the New God the Pale Ones have emerged from the depths of the earth to conquer the world of humans. Since the arrival of men, the Pale Ones have started to use iron armor. Pale One Captains are well respected and inspire humans and Pale Ones alike.
