Not all Colossi nobles study magic. Some serve their queens as sacred guardians of the Orichalcum Palace. Trained from a young age they are only matched in combat prowess by the Gigantes of Black Korkyra. In Phaeacia a strange golden red metal of exceptional durability has been found and mined. It is used to embellish the royal palace, to craft jewelry of unequaled beauty, and most notably used to make the armaments of the Orichalcum Guard. Orichalcum is very difficult to work and only the most accomplished phaeacian craftsmen are able to forge the armaments used by the Orichalcum Guard.
