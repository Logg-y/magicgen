At the Pine of Skulls gather the Skinshifters, Chud Hunters of exceptional skill chosen for their strength at a young age. During his first Bear Feast the young warrior is given an uncooked bear heart by the Perkunus, and is forever changed in flesh and spirit. From now on he is allowed to partake in the sharing of the Bear, in which the Skinshifters feast upon bear hearts to incorporate the sacred bear spirit into their bodies. The Skinshifters are sacred elite warriors able to unleash the rage of the bear when they are wounded. Chud Skinshifters have remarkable recuperative powers, and can heal even the most gruesome wounds over time.
