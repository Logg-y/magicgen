The Skratti is a Jotun sorcerer and user of dark magic. In ancient times, the Jotuns sacrificed blood to their ancestors, the Rimtursar, and the Skrattir were priests and heralds of the Eternal Winter. Their role as priests is now long since lost, but the Skrattir still practice the old ways in a hope to reawaken the Lords of Eternal Winter.
The Gygjas once taught the secrets of skin-shifting to the Skrattir who readily accepted the gift, unaware that it would bind them to the sinister schemes of the Gygjas. With the disappearance of the Niefel Jarls the oldest of the Gygjas withdrew into the Iron Wood and their control over the Skrattir was lost. For a long time the Skrattir were unchecked and replaced the Gygjas in the halls of lesser Jarls and Godes. But then the Jarnvidjur emerged from the Iron Wood. They reclaimed the political influence over the Jarls of Jotunheim, but tasked the Skrattir with their ancient goal of calling the Illwinter to give them purpose.
The enchanted wolf skins of the Skrattir grants them the ability to change shape into huge wolves or werewolves of tremendous strength and regenerative abilities and there are human-told tales of wolf-beasts ravaging entire lands in search for virgin blood.
