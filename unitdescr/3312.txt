The land of Great Feminie is a kingdom in the land of Magnificent Ind. It is ruled by several queens descendant from the proud Amazons of Sauromatia. Women still hold power in the land and the soldiers and knights of the land are invariably female. Any man visiting a lady of the land is allowed to stay for nine days, but if he overstays he will die. Such are the customs of Great Feminie. The Feminie Queens are highly skilled and inspirational commanders. Even after the subjugation, the Queens have remained in power and there is no Viceroy of Ind to rule the Great Feminie.
