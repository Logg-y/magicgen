Marverni slingers and javelineers fight bare-chested and do not use armor or helmets. Instead they decorate themselves in tattoos. The Gutuaters of the tribe instill the tattoos with wild magic and can awaken the powers of the enchanted tattoos in battle. The Marverni tribesmen are known for their bear tattoos.
