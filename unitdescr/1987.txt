The Kohen Gadol are High Priests of the Great Temple in Gath. They lead the yearly sacrifices attended by the entire population of Gath. A few pureblooded Anakim have survived the fall of Ashdod. Huge, horned and six-fingered, they have claimed the priestly authority of the nation and centralized the old cult. The old blood sacrifices of the Melqarts have been renewed and much to the surprise of the surviving Anakim, human blood is almost as strong as the divine blood of the Rephaim. With a vast human population to exploit, suitable sacrifices are no longer hard to find and the bloody practices of the Melqarts are once again tainting the land.
