The Iceclads are the elites of the Airya clan. Since the fall of the Raptors more of the Airyas have turned to martial occupations. The Airyas are blessed with a remarkable resistance to cold and they are the only clan that is considered pure enough to use the ice hauberks made by the Ice Crafters. They wield ice blades and are protected by a transparent shield of ice known as an ice aegis. The ice armor is difficult to make and time consuming to forge. The protection gained from ice armor depends on the temperature of the province. Their ice blades are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
