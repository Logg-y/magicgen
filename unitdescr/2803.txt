This ancient Svartalf is the younger brother of the Eldest Dwarf. Together the two of them learned and mastered their arts of smithing and artifice. But the younger brother did not have the temperament to become as skilled as his brother. As the centuries passed he observed as his brother forged increasingly beautiful artifacts. In jealous rage he stole his brother's most prized possession and fled into the wilderness. He became obsessed with greed and transformed himself into a horrible Linnormr in order to protect his treasures from his elder brother. But the elder brother didn't follow him. Instead he forged mighty weapons and gave them to the heroes of men to challenge and slay his brother, the dragon-dwarf. With the death of the last hero, the dragon-dwarf got tired of the hiding game. Now he has returned to the world of men to claim it as his and slay his brother so no one will try to take his precious treasures from him. When in Linnormr shape his physical might is unrivaled, but his magical powers are drastically reduced.
