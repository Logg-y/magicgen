The Teteo Inan, Mother of Gods, aided a previous Pantokrator in the creation of the world. When she gave birth to a multitude of children, he became furious, despite the fact that they were his. Convinced that she gave birth to spite him and to lead his offspring against him, he slew her, or at least he tried. When she was decapitated blood spurted forth and formed two great serpents where her head used to be. Having failed to slay her, he punished her with eternal imprisonment instead. Now with the Pantokrator gone, She With the Snake Skirt has returned to creation to claim it as her own. The Teteo Inan wears a horrible necklace made of the skulls, hands and hearts of men, and a skirt of writhing snakes. Once beautiful, she is now a horror to behold.
