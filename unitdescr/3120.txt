Strength and athletic prowess are highly valued among the Gigantes of Mekone and sports are popular among men and women. While most Gigantes are trained from birth to become skilled soldiers, there are those who give up their martial training to become professional athletes, but now, when the war against gods has begun, many athletes join the armies once more. Discoboloi are athletes that are skilled at discus throwing. Like all athletes they are also trained in pankration, unarmed combat, but their main use is to bring ranged weapons into battle.
