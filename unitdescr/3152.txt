The Storm Callers of Berytos, bringers of hailstorms and lightnings, once led berytian armies in naval campaigns. But it was trade and tributes that saved Phaeacia when Berytos fell, and the warlike Storm Callers of the Phoenix empire fell from grace. The Wind Callers, descendants of the Storm Callers, have found a new role as traders and shipwrights. They craft and enchant the Dark Ships of Phaeacia, but sometimes travel to distant lands to trade or found new colonies. Like most human inhabitants of the blessed isle, they have unnaturally long lifespans.
