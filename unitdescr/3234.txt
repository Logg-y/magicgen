Vod is a Chud chieftain of great renown. He is reputedly blessed by the Bear and he has led his tribe in numerous successful campaigns and raids on Ulmish settlements. Where he came from is not known. The day his predecessor died he suddenly appeared and claimed to be the Son of the Bear, rightful ruler of the tribe. He has since led the tribe in war and peace. Vod listens to the wisdom of the Perkunus, but he often defies the wishes of the Sons of Heaven. Since his appearance, the cult of the Bear has become more prominent and Vod has become its most influential priest.
