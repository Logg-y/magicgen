The Sauromancers discovered the secrets of dark magic in ancient times and the magic of Death was prudently practiced during these times. However, when Ermor stole the secrets of life and death and perverted them, the Sauromancers changed their ways. Dark rituals were secretly performed in the tombs of ancient kings. Bane Fires were lit in braziers not used for millennia. Dried husks of legendary kings were reawakened to share the thrones of living kings. The Sauromancers have become a priestly order and have all but replaced the remaining High Priests. The Sauromancers of this era are very powerful Death mages and skilled also in Fire magic, which is necessary to light the Bane Fire Braziers. They have partial resistance to poison.
