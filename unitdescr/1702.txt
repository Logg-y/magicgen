The Basalt City is ruled by the Basalt Queens and their consorts. The rulership is divided between the Priestess Queens and the Mage Kings. The Kings however, rarely concern themselves with political matters and spend most of their time staring into the Dark Crystal at the bottom of the gorge in the center of the city. In the pale light of the Basalt Kings' antennae, shades and movements can be seen in the Crystal. What this means is unknown to all but the Kings themselves. The Basalt Kings are masters of Earth magic and were the ones who erected the pillars and halls of the city. They enchant the stone of the city to make artifacts, weapons and armor for the Deep Ones.
