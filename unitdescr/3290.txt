Under each Viceroy Primate there is a number of governors who are also bishops. They perform most of the administrative duties of the government and are tasked with keeping the heathens and cannibals under control. The cannibals themselves don't have the discipline or training to command and lead men and would likely just plunder their own lands were they not reigned in by the Bishop Vicomtes of Ind.
