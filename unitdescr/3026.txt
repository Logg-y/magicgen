The commanders of the Erytheian armies are supposed to lead armies on dry land as well as in the sea. They therefore wear bronze armor, even if they for the most part lead Erytheian phalangites clad in iron. They are given pearl blades, relics crafted in Old Pelagia and once wielded by the first conquerors of the Closed Realm.
