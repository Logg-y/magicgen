Tritons are unable to leave the sea, but mermen can shed their tails and walk on dry land to trade or wage war. The extensive trade with Berytos has given Pelagia a much needed ally. In the few coastal cities Pelagia has built, Berytian infantry have helped in the defense. Over time the mermen have adopted Berytian and Therodian culture and tactics. Now there are few Berytian soldiers left in the cities and Pelagia fields its own mermen infantry. The Shore Fighters are light mermen infantry armed in Berytian fashion. They are able to enter the sea, but they cannot use their javelins under water.
