Machaka is ruled by a royal family of Great Men. When the Lion Clan found Great Mababwe, they found the Colossi. Soon the Colossi adopted the Lion Clan Machakans and made them their servants. With the guidance of the Colossi the Lion Clan became rulers over the other Machakan clans and Great Mababwe became the royal capital. The first Colossi king brought order and civilization to the newly formed kingdom. When he died all his sons were named kings, and all their consorts queens. The Lion Kings are the highest priests of the kingdom and mages of remarkable power. They tend to avoid dull work, such as research, but make great warleaders. Most kings and queens are satisfied with their position, but recently there was a schism in the royal family. Spider's agents discovered a conspiracy that was about to destroy the kingdom.
