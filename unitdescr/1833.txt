In the misty swamps of Pythia dwell the huge, noxious fume breathing, many-headed serpents of legend, hydras. The regenerative powers of the hydra are truly formidable and should one of its heads be cut off, it will regrow within hours. The bite and breath of a hydra is poisonous. Hydras are commonly used in the pits and arenas of Pythium and are deeply feared by soldiers and gladiators alike.
