Some of the oldest and most influential dryads are blessed by Gaia with the power to charm, not just men, but all living things. Plants and animals come to their aid, and few living beings would ever consider hurting them. While peaceful at heart, the Dryad Mothers sometimes join the armies of Pangaea to protect the beasts and plants of the forests.
