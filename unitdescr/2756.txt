The Bolon-ti-ku were nine servants of the Lord of Death. When their master slew his brother Seven Death in jealous rage, the cycle of life and death was unmade. The Bolon-ti-ku were given powers over the nine aspects of death and became viceroys of One Death. But the Pantokrator was outraged and punished the lord of death and his servants with destruction or eternal imprisonment. Now with the Pantokrator gone the mightiest of the Bolon-ti-ku is breaking free. Soon the world will become a place of horror and darkness fit for the triumphal return of One Death. The Bolon-ti-ku is attuned to the circle of life and death and is almost impossible to hurt with normal weapons.
