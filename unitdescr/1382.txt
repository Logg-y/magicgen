Tjatse is an ancient Niefel Jarl and lord of the icy fortress of Trymheim. He is a powerful sorcerer and owns an eagle cloak that grants him the ability to change shape. In the war with the Aesir in ages past, he used this power to capture Idun, Guardian of the Apples of Immortality. Now he follows the Awakening God, eagerly awaiting the Illwinter and the rise of the Rimtursar. When in eagle shape, Tjatse's power in Air magic is increased, but his other magic skills are lessened.
