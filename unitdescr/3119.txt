The Spartoi, sown men, are skeletal warriors in gleaming armors, sprung from the ground where dragon teeth are sown. The Spartoi fight for the duration of the battle, but if victorious they will soon dissolve and return whence they came. Even though skeletal in appearance, the Spartoi are not undead beings, nor are they mindless.
