Chudes are an exalted race of might and beauty far superior to ordinary men. Like their human allies they live divided into two moieties and for the most part have more more in common with their human counterparts than with the Chudes of the other moiety. The Chudes of the second moiety live in small settlements together with humans and only encounter their nomadic kin at betrothal and marriage, as marital customs demand that no one marries within his or her own moiety. The settled Chudes follow less war-like traditions and many have lost the connection with the Bear and his rage. Chud Warriors wield spears and shields, but don't use ranged weapons.
