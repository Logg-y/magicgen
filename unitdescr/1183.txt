The Androphags are a small Sauromatian tribe feared and shunned even by other Sauromatians because of their gruesome practices. Not only do they flay their enemies, they feed on them. The practice of cannibalism was introduced by the Witch Kings and the tribe has been called the Man Eaters ever since. Androphag archers use arrows coated with poison. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The most common motif is the horse, but the Androphags are known to prefer serpent motifs.
