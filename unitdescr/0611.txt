Taurotyrannos the Black Bull is the offspring of a female Pandemoniac and a minotaur bull. The rare hybrids who survive such a crossbreeding are seldom welcomed by society and this was also true in the case of Taurotyrannos. During his early years, he was trained as a Pandemoniac by his mother in the hidden groves of Pangaea. When he came of age, he sacrificed his father and placed his father's skull upon his staff. Now Taurotyrannos has become a most powerful Blood mage. His father's legacy makes him lapse into fits of berserker rage, should he be angered.
