The God Block is a huge carved stone block inhabited since time immemorial by a spirit of vast powers. Once worshiped as a God, the spirit attracted the attention of a previous Pantokrator and was bound to the stone block and bereft of powers. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a reawakening god, ready to claim the earth.
