Most halfmen of Pangaea have brown hides. When a calf with white hide is born, there is much celebration, for the young one is touched by the God and sacred. White centaurs serve as priests and guardians of the sacred Groves of Pangaea, singing the sacred songs and serving the dryads. Others are trained in warfare as sacred centaur warriors of tremendous ferocity.
