The Raktapatas or red-robed monks, are the most common of the Lankan priests. They gather flesh for the Feasts, perform various sacrifices and serve the Rakshasas with administrative tasks. They are greatly feared by the cowed populace, as their presence probably means that a family member has been chosen for sacrifice or as main dish in a Flesh Feast.
