The Iron Guards are elite slave soldiers trained from a young age in Telepylos. Chosen for their physical strength they are superior to all but the Cyclope soldiers. The Iron Guards never retreat from battle. They might get killed to the last man, but they never rout. Or at least that is how they are perceived by Phlegra's neighbors. The truth is a bit more sinister. Since the founding of Phlegra, humans have given their services to the Tyrant masters to gain power over their fellow men. The first Oppressors managed to enslave magically skilled humans with the aid of enchanted collars designed with the aid of the Elder Cyclopes. With time the mages of Phlegra have honed their skills and now not only mages are bound by magical shackles. The Iron Guards are given enchanted slave bands to ensure that they never break in battle. These slave bands do not enhance morale per se, but should the slaves abandon orders or rout from battle the band will cause excruciating pain and possibly kill the wearer. The Iron Guards are braver than most slave warriors, and the knowledge that they might die should they flee, makes them almost unbreakable in combat. The Iron Guards can only be commanded by mages able to control the collars. If all friendly mages are routed or killed they might end up dying. The Iron Guards are privileged as slaves go and serve as personal guards of the Oppressors and elite shock troops used only in the most important battles.
