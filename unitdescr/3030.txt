Since the days of Old Pelagia mermen have encountered and suffered at the hands of human archers and crossbowmen. The Kings and Queens of Erytheia have realized that ranged troops are instrumental if one is to conquer human lands. However, ranged weapons can be useful underneath the waves as well. Erytheian engineers have developed a unique kind of crossbow, the gastraphetes. It is inferior to the common crossbow on dry land, but it allows its wielder to fire arrows in the water, albeit with reduced range.
