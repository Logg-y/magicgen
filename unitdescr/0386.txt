The Neter is a giant of divine heritage. During the rebellion of the lesser gods, the Pantokrator was killed and dismembered. But the Pantokrator was reassembled and brought back by his wife, the Mistress of Magic. The Neter of the Sun was born from the union of the dead Pantokrator and his wife. Upon him was bestowed the authority and might of the sun. He was made a vessel of vengeance and he destroyed the rebellion and slew the Great Antagonist. But the Pantokrator could not reenter the world, bound by his own Law of Death and Rebirth. Now the Neter claims the world in his father's name.
