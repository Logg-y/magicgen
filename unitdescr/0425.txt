Shamblers are Atlantians grown to huge proportions. The shambler thrall is an Atlantian shambler enslaved and corrupted by the masters of R'lyeh. Since shamblers are proud and strong, they cannot be trusted unless totally lobotomized. Thralls are fanatically loyal, but too stupid to carry armaments. A shambler thrall can trample opponents in battle.
