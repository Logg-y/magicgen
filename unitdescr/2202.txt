The Great Siddha is a divine being that has achieved physical and mental perfection. It is an inhabitant of the Celestial Sphere, although it originated in this world and rose to the heavens after enlightenment. Now the Great Siddha has returned to this world in the wake of the previous Pantokrator to claim the world as his. Great Siddhas are able to appear instantly wherever they want. They travel by Will and the Laws of Simultaneity.
