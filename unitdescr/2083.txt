When the Atlantians of the Forsaken Coast finally returned to their ancient home in the deeps they were greeted by a few surviving Atlantians. Mages and Mothers of the Deep had survived the invasion from the fallen star by returning to the ruined basalt cities of an earlier era. Here they had gathered strength and power from the source whence they once came. In the basalt depths they found the means to withstand the mind shattering dreams of the great enemy. The Forgiving Father is an old shambler mage who has survived the fall of Atlantis and accepted the returning Angakut and their iceclad servants. Under the tutelage of Mother Hydra, the Forgiving Fathers have mastered the means to fight the dreams of R'lyeh. They have given up sleep and their minds are strengthened through rigorous mental training. They have also turned their magical practices toward Astral magic.
