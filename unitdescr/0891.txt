In the God Mountain, Sorceresses and Black Sorcerers practice dark magic, train Spider Assassins and forge their deadly blades. The deeper caves of the God Mountain are restricted to the Sorcerers. It is said that the remnants of an ancient God are hidden in the deepest cave of the Mountain, a cave where no light is allowed. It is rumored that the Sorceresses are descendants of this Dead God. When they are seriously wounded, sorceresses will turn into great spiders. Very skilled sorceresses may be able to cast spells even in spider form.
