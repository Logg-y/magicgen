Lion is the greatest of the totemic spirits and his kin are great warriors. Trained for battle, the Lion Clan takes great pride in their War Lions. Sometimes a lion might decide to attack one of the Voices that train them and then it's the duty of the priest to calm or subdue the lion without anyone interfering. The war lions are well cared for and they are stronger and braver than normal lions found in the wild.
