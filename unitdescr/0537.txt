Alcastos was the last priest-king of an ancient nation that had fought Ermor. When his kingdom was crushed, he was brought to Eldregate as a prisoner. He swore to serve the Emperor and tie his kingdom to the Empire, but before he could return from the Holy City, he witnessed the cataclysmic events that destroyed the Empire. Alcastos was cursed to serve the Ashen Empire in death as he had vowed to do in life.
