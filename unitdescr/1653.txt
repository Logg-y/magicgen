A great and ferocious wolf of the Jotun forests. It hunts giants and men and fights with frenzied rage, should it get hurt. Their horrible howls and gory muzzles strike mortals with the fear of Garm, Guardian of the Underworld. Folk tales tell of Jotun wolves changing their shape into sorcerers or vice versa.
