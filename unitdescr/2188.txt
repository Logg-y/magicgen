Pale Ones can live for a very long time and they do not stop growing. These ancient giants have sacred status and serve as sacred warriors of the Agarthan armies. With the arrival of man the Ancients have received better armaments and rigorous martial training. Their presence inspires humans as well as Pale Ones to deeds of greatness. Many Agarthan squads have an Ancient One as group leader around which the young ones gather. With the increasing need for ranged weapons the Ancient Ones have started to carry a couple of rocks to throw against enemies before they close in for a fight.
