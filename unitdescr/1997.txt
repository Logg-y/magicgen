The tribe of Iassachar is a small tribe known for its wisdom. They are prudent to the point of cowardice. They rarely fight, but many of them have become renowned scholars and sages. They are known for their skill in deciphering the sacred scriptures, but they are not allowed to become true priests. Few of these sages have any magical powers, but they have become important in the rediscovery of the forgotten lore of the Grigori. All Iassacharite Sages can research magic, regardless of their magical skill.
