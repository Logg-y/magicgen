Agon, the Eater of Dreams, is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. The Eater of Dreams has emerged several times in history and brought misfortune and suffering to entire kingdoms. It has strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack beings previously marked by Astral magic.
