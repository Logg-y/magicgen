Religion and magic are of little importance in Ulm. Ancestor worship and superstition have long since been discarded. But recently a new religious order has begun to form. The ancient practices of smithing and the Enigma of Steel have evolved into an Iron Cult led by priests dressed in black. Operating from the Black Temple in the Keep of Ulm, the Order is trying to gain influence and power. Magic is feared in Ulm and the Black Priests have proclaimed magic outside religion a heresy. This has caused controversy and led them to a confrontation with the Master Smiths. A few smiths have been ordained as Black Priests. They have been instrumental in the making of the Black Halberds used by the Guardians to smite sacred beings.
