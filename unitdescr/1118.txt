Bandar Log is a very hierarchical society. Markatas are the smallest of the monkey people and their intellect is barely above that of simple beasts. Markatas are small, noisy and annoying, especially when met in large numbers. If alone, they can be used as scouts, but when in greater numbers, they quickly become bored and start to make noise and play with each other. They are generally despised by the larger monkeys and apes. They are sometimes given small bows. This pleases them no end, but they are still not very useful soldiers.
