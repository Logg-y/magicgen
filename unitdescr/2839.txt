The Kouretes are the semi-divine sons of the Daktyloi. They formed a nobility of artists and performers unique to the Therodian culture. Their divine dances brought joy and stability to the land and became a means to rule. Human interpreters followed their processions and artistic works and human servants provided for them. With the fall of ancient Therodos most of them perished, but those that survived still linger on the sacred island of Telkhinis where they still perform the sacred dances to the sound of their sisters' cymbals. In times of war the cymbals and the flutes change the rhythm and the Kouretes dance with furious rage. The Kouretes can enter the sea like their parents, but water is not their natural home and their dances are difficult to perform in the sea. Kouretes are war-dancers and enter a berserk frenzy when blessed.
