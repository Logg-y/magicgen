Machaka is a society of totemic clans. Many warriors come from less important clans such as Antelope, Zebra, and Ape. A disproportionate number of scouts come from the Ape clan. The Ape clan is one of the least influential clans and they are rarely taken seriously. Many followers of Ape hope to gain status and liking by bringing good news. Since they rarely dare tell bad news they tend to be short lived and replaced by competent spies from the Spider Clan.
