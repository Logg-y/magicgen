The Triarii are the last defence of the legionary army. They are handpicked old veterans trusted not to rout. They are given heavy plate armor and long spears and fight in dense formations, much like the hoplites of Arcoscephale. The Triarii have great morale, but they are older and weaker than most soldiers in the Legion.
