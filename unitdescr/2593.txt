After the return of the Raptor clan the Spire Horn Caelians have been replaced as a warrior caste by the Raptors, but there are still many who chose a martial life. The Spire Horn Caelians are able to fly during storms and have partial resistance to cold and lightning. The Spire Horn Caelians are known for their skill in marksmanship. Archery is much preferred over melee combat and most of the Caelian army is comprised of quick and efficient archers armed with composite bows.
