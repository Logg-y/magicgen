In the enchanted forests of Mount Shinuyama live animals gifted with supernatural longevity and magic abilities. When an animal gets older and wiser it becomes increasingly more powerful. The Mujina is a badger several centuries old. Gifted with shapeshifting abilities and magical powers it loves to cause mischief and even harm to travelers and unwary peasants. A favorite guise of many Mujinas is that of a Noppera-bo, a faceless apparition that drives men mad with fear. The Mujina is attuned to magic and its powers are greater where magic is strong.
