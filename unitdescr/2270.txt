When Bandarjuna was born it was obvious he was destined for greatness. His fur was not dark, but white as the fur of the white one Brahmins. His father, a bandaraja of considerable influence, decided that his son was destined to become a great king, and he sequestered the young prince in his palace to learn the ways of a king. But the young prince fled his imprisonment and went out in the world, only to discover suffering and sin. He tried to find the reason behind the suffering, but he would only find more questions. When he was about to despair he found enlightenment, and realized that there was a way to be free of the suffering. An ancient God was awakening, and that God was the answer. All monkeys who trust in him will be saved from the eternal wheel of suffering. Now the Tathagata is spreading the word of enlightenment to the monkey people. As the word spreads, so does the dominion of the Awakening God.
