Jinnun are spiritual beings born from Smokeless Flame in a distant past. They replaced the Hinn and Binn during the reign of a previous Pantokrator. They are naturally invisible and ethereal, but can take physical form when they wish to interact with men. Once the Jinnun lived in Ubar, a magic desert kingdom of marvelous riches. The City of Brass fielded armies of Jinnun, wielding magic and armed with enchanted weapons. These Jinn Warriors are now called upon by the Jiniri Queens of Na'Ba. There are many Jinn races with different abilities and powers, but they are all born from Smokeless Flame and therefore ethereal and invisible unless they wish to be seen. All true-blooded Jinnun are sacred in the queendom of Na'Ba.
