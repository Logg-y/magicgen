Yngvar was the first van adventurer to arrive in the Emerald Empire. He and his oath-bound served the Pythian emperor for two-score years and made themselves a name as mighty warriors and guardsmen before they returned to Vanarus with wealth and glory. Yngvar is a warrior of great prowess, but he is also a van of the old blood, innately skilled in the magic of air and illusions.
