The Carnutes live in the great wood of Carnutes. Here the druids gather annually. The Carnute warriors are well known for their wild and aggressive demeanor. All Carnute warriors are able to go berserk if wounded in battle. The nobles of the Carnutes use chainmail armor of Marverni design. It is a disgrace to a Chieftain not to surpass his tribesmen in valor and for a tribesman to leave a battle when the Chieftain has died means everlasting shame. Thus the mere presence of a Chieftain inspires his fellow tribesmen to great deeds. Carnute chieftains decorate themselves with enchanted boar tattoos.
