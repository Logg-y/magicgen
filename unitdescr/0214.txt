Beast trainers are entrusted with the task of taming and training salamanders for battle. They are armed with iron prods, which they use to drive the salamanders. The beast trainers also have a mystical power that keeps animals from attacking them, making them very useful for dealing with wild beasts such as salamanders or scorpion beasts.
