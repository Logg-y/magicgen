Nemedians are the descendants of the Sauromatian Partholonians. They are a highly magical race far superior to ordinary men, but they were few in number. The Nemedians once warred with the Fomorians and were defeated and subjugated. A few of them still linger in the old fortress Rath Chimbaith. Their champions possess some priestly authority and have some skill in Death and Air magic.
