Nemedians are the descendants of the Sauromatian Partholonians. They are a highly magical race far superior to ordinary men, but they were few in number. With the arrival of the Witch Kings, they left Sauromatia for a better place. The Nemedians followed in the footsteps of their Partolonian ancestors and arrived in the rich land of the Fomorians. Soon war broke out. The Nemedians were victorious until the plague that once eradicated the Partholonians struck them and wiped out half the population. The war ended with the subjugation of the Nemedians. After a bloody rebellion, most of them fled from the land, but a few of them still linger in the old fortress Rath Chimbaith. Nemedian Warriors take great discomfort from iron and use armaments made of bronze and enchanted metals.
