Succubi, or demon lovers, have the appearance of beautiful, nude women with leathery bat-like wings. They are able to enter the dreams of men to seduce and corrupt their souls. A succubus who succeeds in seducing an enemy commander will take him from his bed and fly him to her master, where he will serve until he dies. Men of high moral standing are difficult to seduce and a high magic resistance might prevent the demon from corrupting his dreams. A succubus who fails its attempt at dream seduction will attack the victim physically.
