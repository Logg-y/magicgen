The Umu-apkallu are celestial sages blessed by the Wise Waters. They resemble four-winged Enkidus of great beauty. They serve as messengers of the celestial sphere, but at times they may answer the call of the Mashmashus of Uruk. Umu-apkallus carry milullu cones and medical buckets with which they can cure diseases.
