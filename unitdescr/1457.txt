The Oracles are ancient Pale One mage-priests seated upon thrones in the Halls of the Oracles. They rule the Pale Ones with wisdom and precognitive powers. With the advent of the New God, they have foreseen Agarthan dominance of the surface world and are preparing their subjects for the conquest. In the Halls of the Oracles their perpetual council decides the fate of the world. The Oracles are divided into three orders. The Oracles of Subterranean Waters gain their power and knowledge from the  Womb of the Earth. Here they meditate over the labor of their progenitor and gain insights from the dripping stones and the reflections of the dark pools. If lucky they might encounter an ancient Olm willing to teach them more. Most Oracles of Subterranean Waters are female and it is said that they prefer the company of Olms to that of Pale Ones.
