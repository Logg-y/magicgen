Ktonian necromancers are the administrators and rulers of Agartha. They reanimate corpses to serve the living population in war and peace. Miners, farmers and warriors are all reanimated to serve in the dark halls. The necromancers also perform the sacred Rites of Rebirth on ancient Pale Ones and their Oracles.
