The Queen of Elemental Water is a physical manifestation of the wild magic of Water. Bathusma resembles a body of dark water with the general appearance of a huge, crowned female being. She is innately skilled in Water magic and can summon water elementals from the depths of the ocean. The Queen's body is composed of water and is very difficult to harm when she is underwater. Unless she is completely killed during one combat round, she will heal all her wounds. Bathusma cannot leave the sea. Only three Queens of Elemental Water are known to exist.
