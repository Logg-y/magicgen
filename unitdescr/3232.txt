The iron fly is a strange and dangerous contraption. It can fly at great speed and though it doesn't bite very hard, anyone bitten will get struck by an electrical shock.  The iron flies are not affected by heat, cold, shock or poison.  They are mindless, magical beings that will cease to function if left without magical leadership.
