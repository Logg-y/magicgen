Scouts are trained to pass unseen through enemy territory and to travel efficiently even in mountainous and forested terrain. Their reports on enemy army movements and the resources in enemy lands are invaluable to the prudent warlord. The scouts of Phaeacia are skilled sailors and can cross oceans even without aid of the Dark Ships. Like most human inhabitants of the blessed isle, they have unnaturally long lifespans.
