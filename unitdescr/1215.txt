The Marverni tribes were the inventors of the chainmail armor. The nobles of the Marverni can afford to wear the expensive armor and have formed a warrior caste that rules the Marverni society. It is a disgrace to a Chieftain not to surpass his tribesmen in valor and for a tribesman to leave a battle when the Chieftain has died means everlasting shame. Thus the mere presence of a Chieftain inspires his fellow tribesmen to great deeds. Marverni chieftains decorate themselves with enchanted bear tattoos.
