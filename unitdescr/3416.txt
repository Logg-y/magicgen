The Great Archon is a divine being sprung from the Eighth Sphere, beyond the Seven Heavens. Curious of mankind it manifested itself on the Earth, but Earth was under the dominion of a Demiurge who called himself Pantokrator. The Great Archon tried to guard mankind from ignorance with a Shield of Wisdom, and he taught men how to overcome the restrictions placed on matter and mind by the Demiurge. But the might of the Demiurge was great in his own domain and he discovered the manifestation of the Great Archon and trapped and bound it with shackles of ignorance. For ages the Great Archon wandered the earth as a monster bereft of purpose, suffering from the same condition from which it had tried to save mankind. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the Great Archon can once more protect men from ignorance and lead them to insight.
