The Skratti is a Jotun sorcerer and user of dark magic. Since ancient times, the Jotuns have sacrificed blood to their ancestors, the Rimtursar, and the Skrattir were priests and heralds of the Eternal Winter. But with the Rimtursar gone and the advent of the Awakening God imminent their priestly authority has diminished. The Skrattir still practice the old ways in a hope to reawaken the Lords of Eternal Winter, but their adherence to the old ways and their obsession with reawakening the Rimtursar has made them lose influence to the Gygjas, who serve the Niefel Jarls as advisors on matters of the past, present and future. The Gygjas have taught the secrets of skin-shifting to the Skrattir who readily accepted the gift, unaware that it would bind them to the sinister schemes of the Gygjas. While most Skrattir live for their ancient goal of reawakening the Rimtursar, there are many who have been trapped by the manipulations of the Gygjas and find themselves reduced to mere vessels of life force, fueling the bloody communions of the Gygjas.
The enchanted wolf skins of the Skrattir grants them the ability to change shape into huge wolves or werewolves of tremendous strength and regenerative abilities and there are human-told tales of wolf-beasts ravaging entire lands in search for virgin blood.
