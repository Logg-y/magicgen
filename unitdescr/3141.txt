The Younger Cyclopes are a tribe of one eyed giants herding sheep on the gentle slopes of the Phlegran hills. Each village has its own Shepherd Shaman able to commune with the wild and the Mouflon flocks. The Shamans have some skills in nature magic and are good at leading animals, but they are poor researchers.
