The Atlantian race is an adaptable one. In the deepest gorges of the sea, a breed of Atlantians has evolved that resembles deep sea fish more than toads. These Deep Ones are physically stronger than the other Atlantians and they have higher resistance to the Elements, but their mental faculties are less developed. Deep Ones have huge maws and a glowing antenna in their faces.
