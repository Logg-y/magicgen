When the Atlantians of the Forsaken Coast finally returned to their ancient home in the deeps they were greeted by a few surviving Atlantians. Most of the Mother Guards had died together with their queens, but a few old Atlantian soldiers survived in the basalt cities with the Mothers who sought solace in the depths. Here they were approached by Mother Hydra, the Once and Future Queen. She emerged from her millennial slumber, never to sleep again, and gathered followers forbidden to sleep. The Unsleeping are taught how to resist magical coercion and the urge to sleep.
