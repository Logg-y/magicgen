Born at the dawn of time the Son of Fenrer is the offspring of one of the Great Adversaries. It is a primordial wolf of huge proportions. The monster ravaged the land of men and brought destruction and strife until the previous Pantokrator rose to power and imprisoned the beast for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Son of Fenrer is once more free to roam the bountiful lands of men. The monstrous wolf has inherited the foul temper of his father and is prone to go berserk if anyone opposes him.
