Axiocersa is a Therodian Meliai who took a special interest in the human population of the Telkhine kingdom. She was always more fond of her human subjects than her grumpy daktyloi brothers, and she was sometimes accused of being too close to the humans. It was she and her three sisters that encouraged humans to pursue the arts of her daktyloi brothers, and she taught the humans sailing and ship building. She and her sisters became known as the Kabeirides, mothers of the Kabeiroi craftsmen. Axiocersa is a Meliai of remarkable skill. Her magical powers rival the Hekaterides and her martial prowess as well as strategic abilities are indisputable.
