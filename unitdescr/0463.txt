The fay boar is a breed of magical swine known to exist only in Vanheim. The creatures are sometimes used in warfare, but it is their immortality, not their physical power, that makes them invaluable. The swine are slain each evening to feed the soldiers, but at dawn they are again alive and well, ready to march with the armies of Vanheim.
