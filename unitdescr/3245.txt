During the Malediction, evil was let loose in the kingdom. The Hunger that the evil aroused resulted in cannibalism and practices even worse. Some of the warring nobles succumbed and became vampires who thirsted for human blood. Mircalla was one of these nobles. When her aging spouse waged war upon neighboring counts she pleased herself with younger men. But her lust turned to Hunger and her lovers never lasted long. When her husband returned and found her feasting on ensorcelled men he drew his sword and pierced her heart. They both stared at her chest, realizing that death did not come to her. Furious she tore his head off and drank his blood. With her warlike husband dead she has turned the county into a place of uncanny peace known for its mistress' lavish feasts. Recently she was summoned to a feast even more extravagant, where she was presented with all the blood she could drink. She pledged herself to the awakening god and has since served the lord of Ulm.
