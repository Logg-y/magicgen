The Pearl Clan was the smallest and most secretive of the Triton clans. Few of them had any martial skills, but they were wise and skilled in the magical arts. When the Pearl Kings formed the Pelagian kingdom, the Pearl Clan was given special status and became advisors, mages and priests. While the kings are the highest ranking priests of the kingdom, the Pearl Clan priests administer the temples and ceremonies across the kingdom.
