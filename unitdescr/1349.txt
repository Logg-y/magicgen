Once the Devourer of Souls sat at the foot of the Pantokrator's throne. The Beast would attend the Court of Eternal Judgment and wait for his masters' words as He revealed the names of sinners and the beast would hunt them down and devour their hearts and souls. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Beast of Judgment is free to roam the world. Once the Devourer bites, the unlucky target's soul is gone. This attack cannot be resisted.
