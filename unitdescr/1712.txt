Celestial Masters are high Masters of the Way who have accepted title and training in the Celestial City. Skilled in magic and esoteric arts, they have been revered and respected as religious leaders since the birth of the Empire. Celestial Masters are the highest ranking priests of T'ien Ch'i, but since the founding of the Bureaucracy and the institutionalization of the faith, they have lost much of their religious influence. In the Time of the Barbarian Kings, their influence has dwindled further and few are as skilled as the masters of old.
