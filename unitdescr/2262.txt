More than a generation ago a new power emerged in the Phoenix Empire. Refugees from a distant kingdom arrived with claims of divine heritage. The Colossi Warriors were bodyguards of the refugee Lion Queens and members of the great race of Mababwe. Called 'Colossi' by the historians of Arcoscephale, they are truly superior to ordinary men. The Colossi serve as bodyguards of the Brides and are most often seen guarding the Temple of Storms and Flames or in the numerous sacred processions.
