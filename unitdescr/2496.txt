Obsidian Eye is a member of the Closed Council and the guardian of the Seal. Every birth cycle he ventures down to the Seal to inspect the carvings and the Crack. His knowledge of the Seal is evident in his power over the Umbrals. It was he who encountered the first Umbral, and it was he who crafted the first obsidian glaive. Under his guidance the Seal Guard was formed. Obsidian Eye has foreseen the breaking of the Seal and has become paranoid as of late. When he discovered that some Oracles of the Dead are meddling with binding rituals he was worried. Obsidian Eye is a strong propagator against any meddling with the Umbrals. So far his words are heeded, but if the sun-lit world is to be conquered all possible options must be considered.
