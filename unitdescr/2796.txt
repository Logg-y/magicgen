At the dawn of time, monsters and giants spawned by the Mother of Monsters roamed the world. Among her offspring was a monstrous dog with a mane of writhing serpents and a serpent tail. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned the Mother of Monsters and her offspring. The horrible hound was placed at the Gates of the Underworld to prevent dead titans from returning to the land of the living. Here it was bound for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the Hound of Hades will return to the world of the living.
