Sappers are specialists who dig tunnels under enemy walls in order to make them fall. The sappers of Agartha use the feared Cave Fire, a magical substance created by the Ktonian Alchemists. The Cave Fire makes Agarthan Sappers remarkably efficient at taking down walls. The sappers also use Cave Fire in combat where they toss bottles of the substance against enemies.
