The Fomorian God King is an ancient demigod and servant of the previous Pantokrator who tasked him to rule the Land of the Watery Dead. When his Fomorian kin ravaged the world, the God King was banished from his dark kingdom and punished for his sins, marked with skin as black as the night. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the God King is awakening to recreate the kingdom once denied him. The God King has great power over the dead and the sea.
