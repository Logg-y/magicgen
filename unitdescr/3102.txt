A large part of the human population of Mekone are slaves, but a few prominent men are given freedom for their loyalty, bravery or combat prowess. These freed slaves are called neodamodes. They are not trusted with important tasks, but their lot is far better than that of most humans. Neodamode Peltasts are Helote Peltasts that have survived long enough to be recognized for their remarkable bravery and skill.
