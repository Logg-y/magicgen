A Niefel Giant is a frost giant descended from the old Rimtursar, primordial giants sprung from the glaciers of Niefelheim, land of Eternal Frost. The Rimtursar were hunted and slain by a God of Thunder, but their descendants still linger. Niefel Giants are constantly surrounded by an icy wind and their bodies temper and strengthen in cold lands. Being descendants of the primordial Rimtursar, thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry, and the Niefel Giants greatly fear the wielders of lightning bolts.
