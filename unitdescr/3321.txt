In Magnificent Ind there is a wasteland inhabited by six-fingered giants with skin as pale as death. In ancient times these giants were immensely large and powerful enough to threaten the gods themselves. They are bound to their land by a divine decree, lest they overtake the world. The Kings of the Lost Tribe claim a legacy from the Lords of Civilization and are innately skilled in the magic of the Grigori. They are of an older order and their words are anathema to the faith of Magnificent Ind, thus the Prester King has not asked the Lord to lift the decree.
