The Serpent King is a mighty serpent who is able to take human form. The Serpent King is magically strong enough to claim godhood. In order to lead human soldiers, the Serpent King usually appears in the form of a human sorcerer, but when angered, he transforms into his serpent shape. He is the lord of all serpent-kin and lamias will come to him in additional numbers when he calls them to service. Even though his serpent form is more powerful than his human form, it is still quite weak compared to the majority of the other Pretender Gods.
