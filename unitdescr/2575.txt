Since the fall of the Raptors the Airya clan has gained influence and dominates most functions in the Caelian society. To be of importance you have to be born Airya. To gain status and influence Airya nobles who are unable to join the Seraph order have joined the Iceclads. They rarely become as competent commanders as the Storm Generals, but they often have the time, wealth and backing to gain superior training and equipment.
