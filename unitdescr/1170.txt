The Sauromatians are ruled by women and women fight side by side with male warriors. The Sauromatians allow only women to wear heavy armor. The heavier the armor and horse barding a warrior owns, the higher her place in society. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The most common motif is the horse, but the Androphags are known to prefer serpent motifs.
