The Unfrozen are ancient undead warriors once imprisoned in glacial ice. They have now been freed by an evil mage. The Unfrozen have bony leathery bodies that withstand damage well. Unfrozen lords fight with ancient Bane Blades that cause mortal flesh to decay. The Unfrozen are constantly surrounded by a wind of numbing cold.
