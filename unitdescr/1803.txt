Bres, the Beautiful, is the son of Balor. He is but a century old, but has become the hope of the nation. Untouched by the Curse, he is a living legend. Bres is incredibly handsome and surrounded by an aura of splendor. Regardless of what the Fomorians think of him, he is somewhat of a coward who prefers to live in luxury in the halls of his father.
