When the rebellion of the Jotun Gygjas failed and the last of them retreated into the Iron Wood they were accompanied by a few loyal giants. When the Vaetti Jarldom formed the last Jotun warriors were given tasks the vaettir couldn't fill. The size and strength of the Jotun Warriors make them useful for taking out strong and heavily armed units. However, few of the remaining Jotun Warriors are as skilled as the Huskarls and Hirdmen employed by the Jarls of Jotunheim and Utg√•rd. Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning.
