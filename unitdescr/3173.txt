Melite is the naiad daughter of the river-god Aegaeus of the blessed isle of Phaeacia. When her father was put to sleep by a celestial decree she waited by his side and tended the river banks and the greenery surrounding the river. When men came to the island she silently watched. For centuries she hoped that the presence of men would wake her father from his eternal sleep, but her wait was in vain. When Phaeacia lost contact with Berytos and the Gigantes arrived she took an interest in the lives of men. She approached those living close to her sleeping father and aided them with her gifts of healing and fertility. With time the queens of Phaeacia took notice and contacted her. At first suspicious, Melite now aids the queens hoping that her sleeping father might awake when ancient decrees are broken and the Phaeacian God arises. Melite is a naiad and would slowly die if she left her fathers side.
