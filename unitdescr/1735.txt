The Kala-Mukhas, Black Faces, are the halfbreed offspring of a Rakshasi and a Bandar male. They have darker skin, bulging muscles and are sacred to the monkey people in Lanka. Most Kala-Mukhas are trained as priests and mages, but some are given martial training as sacred warriors. They have partial darkvision and huge appetites, a legacy of their mothers.
