The Shahs are petty kings of Ragha. There are Turan as well as Airya Shahs, but they are likewise limited in power. The power of the Shah stems from the kingdom and not from the Shah himself. Unless inaugurated by a High Magus, his powers are insignificant in the eyes of the Raghans. One among the Shahs can be appointed Shahanshah, King of Kings. The power of the Shahanshah is linked to the land and the land is linked to the Crown forged by the orders of the High Magi. Only the Shah given the Crown of the Shah can wield the full sacred powers of the kingdom. At times the Shahanshah has been Airya, at times Turan. The Shahs are given priestly authority upon inauguration and are considered sacred, regardless of heritage.
