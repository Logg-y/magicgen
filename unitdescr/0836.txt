Elementals are projections of raw elemental power given life through strong magic. All elementals shrink in size and power when severely damaged. There are four kinds of elementals. Water elementals can attack by crushing and drowning enemies. They are somewhat resistant to heat and flames. Water elementals that are summoned in cold climates are composed of ice. Ice elementals are stronger but slower than normal water elementals.
