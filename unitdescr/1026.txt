The Carrion Dragon is the living carcass of an ancient Dragon that was powerful enough not to remain dead after it was slain. Pure hatred and vengeful thoughts rejoined the soul of the dead Dragon with its moss-covered corpse. The Carrion Dragon is able to adopt the shape of a dead Pan. The body of the Carrion Dragon is less suited for spell casting than the shape of the Pan. In dragon shape most of its magic skills are reduced. The paths of Death and Nature are innate to the Carrion Dragon and his skills in those paths are less reduced.
