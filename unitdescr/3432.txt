The Skratti is a Jotun sorcerer and user of dark magic. In ancient times, the Jotuns sacrificed blood to their ancestors, the Rimtursar, and the Skrattir were priests and heralds of the Eternal Winter. The Skrattir were twice outmaneuvered by the Gygjas and little has changed with the coming of the Norns. Their role as priests is now long since lost, but the Skrattir still practice the old ways in hopes of reawakening the Lords of Eternal Winter.
The enchanted wolf skins of the Skrattir grants them the ability to change shape into huge wolves or werewolves of tremendous strength and regenerative abilities and there are human-told tales of wolf-beasts ravaging entire lands in search for virgin blood.
