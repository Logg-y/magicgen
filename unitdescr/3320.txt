In Magnificent Ind there is a wasteland inhabited by six-fingered giants with skin as pale as death. In ancient times these giants were immensely large and powerful enough to threaten the gods themselves. They are bound to their land by a divine decree, lest they overtake the world. Now they are lesser in stature and might, but the decree still holds and the Giants of the Lost Tribe cannot leave their home for an extended period of time.
