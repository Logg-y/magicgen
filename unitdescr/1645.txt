The Judges are judicial magisters and investigators. They track down criminals and put them to swift trial in local courts. Many Judges have complemented their judicial studies with magical studies of Death or Fire to better question the dead and the living. The Magisters of Chelms have developed magical techniques that allow them to work under the Curse and they are unaffected by a Drain dominion.
