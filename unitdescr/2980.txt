The Uttervast is a primordial being of godlike power. Its mere presence is a threat to the world, so it was banished to the void whence it came by a previous Pantokrator. The Uttervast is composed of spheres of stellar lights and shadows. It can project its otherworldly mind on lesser beings and destroy them from afar. Anyone attacking the primordial god-being will find themselves harmed by strange principles of primordial correspondence between the vast and the singular.
