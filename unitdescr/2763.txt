Mam Lum, the Grandfather Earth, is an ancient Basalt King who found his way into the flooded caverns ages ago. He led the Bacabob in conquest of the Xibalban underworld, but he was struck by sleepiness and fell into torpor soon after the flooded city was claimed by the Muuch. For ages he has slept in the darkest depths of Xibalba. But with the return of the Chilan priests and their whispers of an Awakening God, his torpor was disturbed and he arose from the dark waters and brought with him his sleeping descendants, the Bacabob. Now the sleeping giants of the depths have claimed dominion over the returning Zotz. Mam Lum now casts greedy eyes on the watery depths of the oceans he once knew. Mam Lum is a powerful mage and is believed to be a divine messenger of the Awakening God.
