The Duiu of War is a giant of divine heritage once given mandate over war and conflict by a previous Pantokrator. Eager to consummate his mandate the Duiu of War brought strife and turmoil to mankind. Alliances were broken and families divided, tribes were slaughtered and villages burned to the ground. The prayers of mankind took a different tone and the Pantokrator listened and watched. He witnessed a war torn land where mankind no longer prayed to him, but to the destroying god of war and strife. Furious the Pantokrator shackled the Duiu of War on a slab of stone with bonds of lightning, planted an oak atop the shackled Duiu and told the oak to grow for eternity. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, the oak is dying and the power of thunder has been claimed by an unknown entity. Soon the oak will have rotted away and mankind will once more slay their kin.
