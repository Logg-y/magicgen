Enkidus are large, hairy wild men with horns and unkempt hair. They live and frolic with the beasts of the wilderness and have only a vague notion of the concept of civilization. There are three Enkidu tribes. In the swamps lives a tribe known for their foul temper and cruel ways. The Head Hunters are Reaver champions and leaders of the hunter Enkidus. They collect skulls, bones, and other tokens of victory from defeated foes. Their berserker rage is almost unequaled.
