A Lemur Senator is the spirit of an ancient Scelerian Senator that has been brought back from the Underworld. The Senatorial class served as the political and religious leaders of Sceleria and they rarely led armies. Lemures are permeated with the magic of the Soul Gates and they are innately attuned to arcane magic. Not only are they stronger in lands of magic, but their understanding and abilities to study arcana is increased where magic permeates the land.
