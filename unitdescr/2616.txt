The six great Daevas are divine demons and emanations of the Destructive Spirit. Each Daeva of the Heptad represents an aspect of their Lord, opposed to the Amesha Spentas of the Lord of Wisdom. Taurvi is the Daeva of Destruction. She is opposed to Haurvatat, Spenta of Waters and principle of wholeness. Taurvi will cause destruction and turmoil where she dwells.
