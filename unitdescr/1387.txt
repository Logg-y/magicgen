The Order of the Sauromancers is a secretive one and only after passing three rites of initiation is one considered a full member of the Order. When an initiate has passed the second initiation, the Rite of Rebirth, in which he is symbolically killed and entombed, he is given the title of Reborn and granted responsibilities and freedom.
