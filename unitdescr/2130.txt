The Manticore, or man-eater, is a horrible half-beast that prowls the wilderness. Sometimes they attack remote villages and devour its inhabitants and livestock. The Manticore has the body and mane of a lion, the head of an imbecile man with three rows of teeth, great flapping wings and the tail of a scorpion. It is horrible to behold and strikes fear into the hearts of men.
