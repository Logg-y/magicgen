Serpents, large lizard-like predators, have been domesticated to replace the horse in warfare since horses are very rare in Pythium. The serpents are aggressive, but lack the speed of horses. Since the serpents are valuable, they are armored in the heaviest possible barding. The cataphract is Pythium's most expensive and powerful unit and only the most wealthy and elite soldiers have the opportunity to join a cataphract squadron.
