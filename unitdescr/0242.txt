The Hiereia is an arcoscephalian priestess. The priestly occupation in Arcoscephale is restricted to women. Since early times, aspiring priestesses are raised in monasteries far from city life where they study Nature magic and the healing arts. Upon reaching full sisterhood, a priestess is permitted to leave the monastery to travel the land and serve the awakening god with their remarkable healing skills.
