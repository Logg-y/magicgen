Tsunekage is one of the most ruthless of the Demon Generals of Yomi. To impress his subjects, he has adopted cannibalistic practices and has eaten the hearts of several insubordinate Oni. This has given him quite some fame among the Oni. Eating Oni hearts has had unforeseen effects on his young body and Tsunekage is now stronger than ever and his body regenerates wounds at impossible speed.
