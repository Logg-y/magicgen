The Angel of Fury is the Scourge of the Lord, Chastiser of the Unlawful and Destroyer of False Prophets. It is dressed in robes smeared with the blood of unrepentant sinners. Anyone striking the Angel of Fury will be punished for his sins and take the damage himself. Angels of Fury are utterly silent and will not command armies. It is an instrument of punishment and its powers are those of retribution, not leadership.
