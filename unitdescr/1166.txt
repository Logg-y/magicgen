The Tomb Guards are the elite force of C'tis. They serve the Keepers of the Tombs and protect the ancient structures of the desert. They rarely leave the Sacred Desert, but when they do, the enemies of C'tis tremble. The Tomb Guards are larger and stronger than their brethren and their dust-colored skins are almost impregnable.
