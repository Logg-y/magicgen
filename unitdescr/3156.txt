The Colossi men of Phaeacia often become traders and sailors. Since Phaeacian warfare is mostly naval, the commanders of the phaeacian armies are often male. Most Colossi noblemen are trained in the arcane arts. Those of great minds become skilled mages and advisors to the queens, while those of lesser arcane aptitude are placed under the tutelage of the Wind Callers to become captains of the phaeacian fleets. They are not as powerful mages as the Wind Callers, and their role is primarily as commanders of the phaeacian fleets.
