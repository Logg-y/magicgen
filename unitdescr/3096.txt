The mages of the Deep are shambler mages and the predecessors of the Kings of the Deep of later times. They are not nearly as powerful as the Basalt Kings and should one become too powerful, he would probably be killed. The shambler mages use a slightly wider spectrum of magic then the Basalt Kings. The mages of the Deep have the ability to grant water-breathing abilities to a few followers.
