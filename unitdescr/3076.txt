The Morrigna is a tripartite entity of divine heritage. She is one with her sisters and her sisters are one with her. The trinity was given power and purpose by a previous Pantokrator. One sister was given mandate over battles, one sister was given mandate over life and death, and one sister was given mandate over the fates of men. She was the Battle Crow, witnessing the slaughter and the dying, pecking at the bodies of the fallen ones. Out of fear and desperation men begun to worship the sisters and they tried to placate her with sacrifice and prayer. The Morrigna accepted their worship and turned battles to their favor. Furious the Pantokrator imprisoned her in the Charnel House, a labyrinthine prison of human bones. Now with the Pantokrator gone the prison is crumbling and the sisters will once more decide the fates of men. The Morrigna is a trinity. She is stronger if all three sisters are together and weaker if the sisters are separated.
