Manflayers are prominent warriors of their tribe who have slain several enemies in battle and flayed them. They place the skin of their fallen enemies on a gruesome standard and inspire their fellows to ferocious bravery. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The number of tattoos represent standing in society and more prominent warriors are covered in dark etchings.
