The Rakshasi is a female demon-ogre of Lanka. She appears as an ugly, monstrous crone with black skin and protruding tusks. The Rakshasi is skilled in sorcery and is able to change shape into an alluring redheaded Manushya Rakshasi. In Manushya shape the Rakshasi can only be revealed by her insatiable hunger. Rakshasis sometimes mate with prominent Bandar kings and give birth to dark skinned Kala-Mukhas. Rakshasis are descendants of the Danavas and Daityas of ancient times and are vulnerable to fire.
