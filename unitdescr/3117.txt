The power in Mekone is divided between the Basileus, the Archons and the Polemarchs. The Basileus is the priest-king of the Gigantes. By virtue of might he has claimed his title. Surpassed only by the Elder Cyclopes in magical might the Basileus is a also the ceremonial master of the public cult of the god-slayer of Mekone. Revered by his kin and worshipped by humans the Basileos is almost a god in his own right. Once a year he inaugurates a champion of the god-slayer in a purifying bath of water and flames.
