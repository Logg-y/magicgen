Potent Nature mages do not die easily, and even when they die that may not be the end of them. When the worms and bugs that feed of carrion devour the corpse of a dead Nature mage, some of those mages manage to transfer a portion of their mind and power into the crawling mass feeding on their remains. This being houses the life force of such a mage and it is formed by thousands of worms and bugs. Should it be slain in combat its body will dissolve into a myriad of bugs that will still contain the life force of the mage. If left undisturbed it will not take long for the mage to form a new body capable of casting spells. The Worm Mage can also enter the sea and when doing so it will simply make use of shrimps and other underwater bugs instead of the usual beetles and worms.
