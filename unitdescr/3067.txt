Lictors were once Ermorian dignitaries entrusted with keeping the peace during the heyday of the Empire. With the rise of Sceleria and the emergence of the Death Cult, their responsibilities changed and the Lictors served the Thaumaturgs as keepers of the dead. With the fall of the empire and the rise of Lemuria spectres of the former dignitaries emerged from the Soul Gates to hold the silent dead in line. The Lictors had a sacred task in life, and in death their role and status remains.
