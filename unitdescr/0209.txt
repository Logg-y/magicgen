The Mother Guards of Atlantis are Coral Guards grown to huge proportions. They combine the rigorous military training of Coral Guards with the physical strength of the shamblers. These shamblers have been armed with the glaive of the war shamblers and the coral armor of the Coral Guard. The Mother Guards are the honorary guards of a Coral Queen. They are sacred troops and can be blessed by the Queen.
