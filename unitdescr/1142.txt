The White Ones are the highest of the castes. They are white-furred Vanara who are gifted with superior mental capabilities. White Ones are considered sacred and are the true lords of the kingdom. They are aloof and rarely concern themselves with matters of politics, but when they do, even the Bandar listen to their advice. Some White Ones choose the path of war rather than philosophy. These individuals fight as sacred warriors. The linen of their armor is white, but they wear a red piece of cloth to represent their choice of the martial path.
