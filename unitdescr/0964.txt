The Lord of Fertility is a naked giant gifted with powers of fertility. His mere presence causes crops to grow and babies to be born. His divinity manifests itself in his horns. His Cornucopia, the Horn of Plenty, brings forth enough food to feed fifty soldiers. The Lord of Fertility is a master of Nature magic.
