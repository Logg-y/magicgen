The High Seraphs are the highest ranking of the Seraphs. With the disappearance of the Eagle Kings they have turned from administrators and judges to rulers. They live in the Palace of Frozen Crystal where they decide the future of Caelum. The memory of the fall of Ravens' Vale has led them to prudence and seclusion from other societies. Only recently has any contact been made with the outside world. The High Seraphs are mighty Air mages and are also skilled in the path of Water. A few of them still remember and use the dark magic of the Harab Seraphs, but those that do are looked upon with suspicion and distrust.
