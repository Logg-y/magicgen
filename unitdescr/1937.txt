The Starets, or Elders, are mages of great renown who have left their princes to study in the opulent Hall of the Elders in the Red City. The Elders are the most respected mages of Bogarus and their skills are used by the Grand Princes in exchange for riches and political influence. With the coming of the New Faith the Starets have found themselves coerced into serving in military campaigns.
