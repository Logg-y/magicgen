The Wingless are misshapen Caelians born in Ravens' Vale. The recent occurrence of these mutations is cause for great alarm in Caelian society. Ostracized and lonely, the Wingless often join the armies of Caelum to earn some respect or die trying. They fight ferociously and do not falter in the face of a welcome death. The Wingless are given light armor, wooden shields and spears. They are neither cold resistant nor winged. Their ice lances are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
