During the Golden Era, there were still pegasi living on the cloudy peaks of Mount Cephalos. The pegasi are captured and brought to the temple at the base of the mountain, where they are trained as mounts for the Wind Riders. Sometimes a youngster arriving at Mount Cephalos for martial training is approached by pegasi. These blessed ones are given special status and priestly training otherwise restricted to women. After years of rigorous training they become priest commanders of the wind riders.
