Illithids are members of a once great race from a distant star. The body of an Illithid resembles a pink mass of writhing tentacles. They cover their bodies in robes made of strange flowing materials. Their heads are squidlike, with tentacles where their mouths should be. The mere touch of an Illithid sucks the life force out of living beings. Illithids are mentally powerful beings, able to paralyze enemies by sheer strength of mind. The soldiers and lords of the race are equipped with plate cuirass and tridents. All Illithids are amphibious.
