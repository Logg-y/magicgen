With the emergence of the Cult of the Solar Bull, the soldiers of the Limes found a source of comfort otherwise unavailable to them. With the Serpent Cult and its temples and uncaring priests far away, the Cult of the Solar Bull attracted young soldiers with its glorification of battle and promises of a better afterlife. Those who have joined the Cult of the Solar Bull have become blessed with mystic powers. They fight with increased skill and morale and boast partial resistance to fire and flames. In honor of their Lord, they paint flaring suns on their shields.
