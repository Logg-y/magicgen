The Titan of Crossroads a giant of divine heritage sprung from the three phases of the moon in primordial times. Being spawned thrice she would claim power over birth, life and death. When a previous Pantokrator rose to power she used the veil of the night to shroud herself in mystery and withdrew her powers to avoid his jealous gaze. Only when the great Adversary abducted the daughter of the Pantokrator and death came to the world she revealed herself and would use her torches to light up the Underworld so that The Spring could be found and life returned to the world. The Pantokrator rewarded her by giving her authority over Birth, but the Titan reminded him that she was threefold and the Pantokrator grudgingly gave her authority over crossroads and threefold powers. The Lampadephoros, light-bearer, with her spirit-revealing torches and guardian dogs was given the task of protecting mankind from the spirits of the night. The Kleidouchos, key-holder, was given authority over thresholds and gates in this world and others. The Kourotropos, nurse of children, was given power over birth and healing herbs. But the Titan of Crossroads was not satisfied. She accepted worship and gave to mankind what was not meant to be known. The three of them gave away the necromantic secrets of the Underworld, the knowledge of poisons and the mysteries of the threshold. Worshiped in secret by witches and midwives around the world her powers grew. When the Pantokrator finally found out he imprisoned her for eternity beyond the Gate of Only One Direction. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Titan of Crossroads has found a way to unseal the Gate and return to claim the world as hers.
The key-holder carries the Key to Every Entrance and can open gates to distant lands. She can also open a gate and bring her other two form to her location.
