Sauromatians are more impressed with war than faith, so even their priestesses have to be skilled in the ways of battle. Only the most prominent fighters are allowed to become priestesses and it is more a title than an occupation. Warrior priestesses are well respected, but not for their priestly powers. Most Sauromatians decorate themselves with tattoos. The number of tattoos represent standing in society and more prominent warriors can be covered in dark etchings.
