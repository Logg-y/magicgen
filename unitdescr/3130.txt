The Trophimoi are human students that come to Phlegra to study ancient lore. Some of them become enamored with the Phlegran culture and devote themselves to the Gigantes and their awakening lord. The Gigantes themselves are not much bothered by celebrating faith, so these Trophimoi are ordained as priests of an unorganized church and sent to foreign lands to proclaim the superiority of the Gigantes.
