The vila is a powerful female spirit of the wild. The mountain vila appears as a naked woman mounted on a stag. Her beauty is only marred by her hoofed feet and anyone rude enough to mention this fact will be struck down or cursed for the rest of his life. The mountain vila can fascinate and lure men into servitude with her spellsongs and otherworldly beauty. She has the power to give and take health and is a powerful mage of Nature.
