The Muuch are descendants of the Atlantians that invaded the Xibalban caverns after the great flood. They resemble toads and have become known as toad men, although they have some fish-like traits as well. The Atlantians never used ranged weapons, but the Muuch have adopted some of the weapons of the former inhabitants of the cavernous realm. Obsidian darts are occasionally used as a complement the Muuch infantry.
