When alive the Praetorian Guard served as the bodyguards of the Thaumaturgs. The Guard consisted of old veterans given the honor when they left their old careers. The members of the Praetorian Guard were all very skilled and brave, but their age made them weak. Now when they are dead the weakness from old age is gone, but their great skill in combat remains.
