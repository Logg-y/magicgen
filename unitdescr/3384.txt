The Sahira is a Jiniri Queen born before the fall of Ubar. Raised and trained in the City of Brass before the fall, her magic skills far outshine her sisters' and the Jann sorcerors'. When Ubar fell she hid for centuries and practiced her arts. Now she has returned and donned a godly mantle. She is now God-Queen of the Jann, the 'Adites and the humans of Na'Ba.
