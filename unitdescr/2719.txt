The Camazotz were once powerful Zotz sorcerers. Their skills in dark magic were considerable, but they were unable to observe the skies. Thus they were unprepared for the falling star and could not protect the Zotz from the cataclysmic flood that destroyed Xibalba. Now, with the caves filled with water and toads, few of the Zotz remain. In isolated caves the Camazotz try to keep old memories and ancient lore alive. But with the Awakening imminent, the Bacabob have approached the Zotz and the surviving sorcerers to ask for their aid in the upcoming war.
