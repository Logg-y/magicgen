The success of R'lyeh is largely due to their powers of mind control. By enslaving other peoples, they have built a slave-based society with few dissidents. The lowest and most trusted of the slaves are the Lobo Guards. These beasts are mindless Atlantians who have served as slaves until mental abuse has broken them. Now they serve as perfectly loyal guards and arrow fodder.
