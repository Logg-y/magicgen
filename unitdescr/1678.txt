Deepthought is an ancient Olm grown to huge proportions. It is rarely seen but well known among the Wet Ones of the Deeper Caverns. Its mind and might have grown with its body and it has been called upon several times to give advice to the Oracles on matters of the Deeper Waters. When Emberstream made her journey to the Womb of the Earth she encountered Deepthought and was given tutelage and advice. Since the meeting with Emberstream the Ancient Olm has become the voice of the Olms and the two races have come closer. Now, with the demise of Emberstream, Deepthought is the most powerful water mage in Agartha and it has been granted a seat in the Closed Council.
