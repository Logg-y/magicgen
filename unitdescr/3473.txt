The Firstborn of the Smokeless Flame is a mighty spirit entity of an earlier era when the Jinnun, and not men, dominated the world. When the previous Pantokrator allowed mankind to replace the Jinnun and demanded that the Firstborn and his servants bow to man, he rebelled. He, a being of pure flame, would never bow to creatures of dirt and mud. And so he led the Jinnun in war against humanity. The Pantokrator was furious, cursed him and imprisoned him in the Desert of Red, White and Black Sands for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Firstborn of the Smokeless Flame can once more wage war upon men and restore the Jinnun to their former might.
