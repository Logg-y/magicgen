When the armies of Arcoscephale marched beyond the borders of the known world, they found the mighty kingdom of Bandar Log. The armies dared not venture any further lest they lose their humanity like the Bandar must have done. During the brief visit, they gained a valuable ally in the Cerulean Maharaja. The Maharaja gave the generals of Arcoscephale an army of apes from his personal retinue. The Bandar warriors of the Cerulean Legion followed the Arcoscephalean armies returning to their homeland, where they were given a portion of the capital and a mighty tower to defend. Now the Cerulean Warriors in their blue armor have become known among the enemies of Arcoscephale as fierce and skillful warriors.
