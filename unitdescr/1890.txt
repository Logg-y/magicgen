The people of T'ien Ch'i have always been obsessed with physical health and long life. Masters of the Way quest for immortality through internal alchemy and asceticism. Other less esoteric practices are more popular with the common folk. Herbal medicine as a means to health and longevity has become widely used and apothecaries ply their trade in most settlements of the Empire. The apothecaries of T'ien Ch'i are skilled at herbalism and are able to cure diseases. Constant exposure to poisons and remedies has made them somewhat resistant to poison. If threatened, they flick envenomed darts at their attacker.
