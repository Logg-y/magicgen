Afarit are powerful Jinnun born from Smokeless Flame. Endowed with exceptional physical and magical might, they are arrogant and cruel, and might be perceived as outright evil. Once rulers of the magical kingdom of Ubar, the Afarit were scattered and lost when the magic of the world dwindled and died. Now, with magic scarce, the Afarit are drawn to the smell of sacrificial blood. Afarit are spiritual beings and are invisible until they manifest. When wounded they reveal their true form, ablaze with Smokeless Flame, a pure green and yellow fire of incredible heat. Afarit are attuned to magic and are stronger in provinces where magic is strong.
