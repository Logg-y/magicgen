The Rephaim of Gilead are the most numerous of the giants. While most fight with spear and shield, some are trained as archers. When the Tide of Fire was unleashed from Abysia the archers of Gilead became instrumental in averting disaster. The Abysian war machine was heavily dependent on Anathemants protected by heavy infantry and the Gileadite archers were able to out-range all but the most powerful mages with their great bows. They are equipped with the heaviest possible scale armor and bows of remarkable size and power. Few can stand against the archery formations of Gilead. The hunger of the ancient Rephaim is lessened and no longer do the Rephaim eat their kin.
