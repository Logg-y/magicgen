Enaries are prominent spirit guides and soothsayers. They set themselves apart by donning women's clothing and wearing jewelry. They speak with voices pitched pleasant to the spirits they serve. They live apart from society but are often called upon to judge in matters of spiritual importance. Enaries have a slight chance of preventing bad events.
