The Red Face is the firstborn of the Sacred Cenote and first among the Chak Muuch assassins. His patience is legendary and he once stalked his prey until it died of old age. With increasing age his attention has turned from assassinations to other tasks. His lesser kin were able enough in the eyes of the Bacabob. He is probably the most skilled fighter in the flooded city, but he has had time to study magic, and being the firstborn of the Sacred Cenote he has become almost as influential as the Bacabob. Now with the Awakening of the True God his services are once more required.
