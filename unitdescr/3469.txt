Since the City of Brass was sealed, the Jinnun haunt the ruins known to man as Iram of a Thousand Pillars. The Emir is a Jinn noble serving the imprisoned Sultans of Ubar. With the imminent awakening of the God, the Emirs and their Jinn Warriors have initiated the war upon mankind to please the Lords of Ubar. They are skilled commanders and are adept in the magic of the Jinnun. For the Jinnun, military training is time consuming, compared to arcane studies, and the armies of Ubar fields fewer Emirs than sorcerers.
