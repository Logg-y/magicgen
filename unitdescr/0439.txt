The mound fiend is the spectre of an ancient priest-king of a death cult. The mound fiend can reanimate the recently dead and can curse the living with the Hunger. They are powerful mages of Death and are always surrounded by a wind as cold as an empty grave. The mound fiend is a spectre and thus ethereal and able to enter the sea.
