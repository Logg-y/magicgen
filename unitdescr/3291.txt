The subservient lands of heathens are ruled by Viceroys who are also high priests and generals. They reign in the heathen tribes and prepare for their eventual release upon the world. The Viceroy Primates are administrative rulers and rarely lead the cannibal tribes into battle. The Viceroy Primates regularly return to Magnificent Ind to drink from the Fountain of Youth and most of them have lived for centuries.
