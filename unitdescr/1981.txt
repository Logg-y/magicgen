The Dust Walker is a soldier entombed in desert sands together with his king in ancient times. Dust Walkers have bony, leathery bodies that withstand damage well. They are constantly surrounded by a dry, parching wind. Dust Walkers are resistant to fire, but not to cold as most other undead are. They fight with ancient weapons and wear linen armor.
