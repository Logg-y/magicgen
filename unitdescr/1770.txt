A Cu Sidhe is a huge, dark green fay hound. They once roamed the plains and woodlands, but with the coming of man, they have retreated into the Land of the Ever Young. A few can also be found in desolate highlands where they are said to lure pregnant women into Sidhe mounds. The Cu Sidhe serve the Sidhe as companions and hunters and often fight by their side. They are sacred and can be blessed.
