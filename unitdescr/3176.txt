Eurytion is a Cyclops Shepherd Shaman that has left Phlegra for adventures abroad. He soon found that mankind did not appreciate neither his good looks nor his gentle demeanor. Driven from land to land he finally ended up in the land the setting sun, where he met the first being kind to him. This was Geryon, the three-headed Gigante guarding the red cattle of the underworld. Being a giant himself, Geryon found a kindred soul in the lost cyclops and gave him shelter. When Geryon realized Eurytion's skill as a herdsman and asked if Eurytion would tend his herds. Given hope and purpose Eurytion has remained in the land of the setting sun ever since, guarding the cattle of Geryon.
