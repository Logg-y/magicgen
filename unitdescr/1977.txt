Abysian mages have recently discovered a gorge near the borders of Gath, where ancient magic has been uncovered by eroding winds and a mighty earthquake. Huge bones were found protruding from the very stone. Legends of the glorious victory against the Rephaim were remembered and soon Abysian mages were trying to reawaken the fossilized giants once defeated by fire in the valley of Megiddo. Fossilized giants are as hard as stone, but somewhat brittle. Ancient bronze armor has partially merged with their darkened bones.
