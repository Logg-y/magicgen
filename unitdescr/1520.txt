Aboleths are ancient beings sprung from the depths of the ocean. They resemble huge mud-crawling fish with tentacles and large, dark eyes covering their foreheads. As they grow in size, they shed the scales of their Giboleth form and become paler and softer. Aboleths have the ability to project their will on others and can dominate lesser beings with sheer strength of mind. Through their superior minds, the Aboleths have enslaved other water-dwelling races and built an underwater slave-based empire. The larger and older an Aboleth is, the more powerful his powers of domination.
