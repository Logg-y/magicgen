The Berytian mage pilots were renowned for their navigational skills. When Berytos fell, the mage pilots remained in Phaeacia. Their skills were instrumental when the Dark Ships were first made. Mage Pilots use Air and Water magic and can sail across the oceans even without the aid of the Dark Ships. Like most human inhabitants of the blessed isle, they have unnaturally long lifespans.
