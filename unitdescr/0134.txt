The most distinguished of the men-at-arms are promoted to the ranks of the Royal Guard. The Royal Guard is the jewel of the army, clad in gilded armor and riding upon proud horses. The Royal Guard are in charge of protecting the Royal Family as the men-at-arms protect the nobles of the kingdom. To practice and hone their skills they partake in mock-fights and jousting tournaments, a lethal sport indeed. Only by donning the heaviest armor possible do they avoid death or injuries.
