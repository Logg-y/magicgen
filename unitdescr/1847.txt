Golog is the oldest Oracle alive. His skin has taken on a greenish, moldy color, his back is bent and his girth is considerable. He witnessed the preparations to conquer the sunlit world and he spoke against it. He witnessed the arrival of men and their worship and he spoke against it. Now he has witnessed the arrival of a New God and he spoke against it. But Golog knows, as he has known before, that his counsel will not be heeded. Golog clings to that which was and that which still is: Corpses and memories of the dead. After the Kin-Breaker's defeat, he began the practice of mummification to make sure no one would forget. But his obsession with memories didn't stop with that. Soon he would try to make the dead speak of their memories, for the dead do not forget. Golog has now created himself a mummified host of living memories. Each month, more and more of his mummified servants gather to tell stories of ancient times, when humans were not. His denunciation of the New God has robbed him of his former Oracular status and influence.
