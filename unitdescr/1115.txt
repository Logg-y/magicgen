Augur Elders are masters of augury. Their skills are considerable and they guide emperors and generals alike, but they are rarely trusted. Recently they have become even more secretive and rumor has it that they have divined the end of the Empire. The Elders have sent several expeditions to the ancient kingdom of C'tis to find an old path of magic that will lead the Empire to world domination.
