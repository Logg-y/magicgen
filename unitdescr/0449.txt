Frost fiends are devils of the icy reaches of the demon realms. In the constant wars of Inferno, the frost fiends are feared by all fiery devils. They wear robes of woven ice and are constantly surrounded by an icy wind. They wield ice rods and can unleash blasts of infernal cold upon their enemies. They can only be summoned if human blood has been sacrificed. Their powers increase in cold lands.
