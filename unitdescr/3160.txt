The Hesperides are the nymphs of the sunset. They tend the gold apple tree in the fabled garden of the setting sun. The garden is hidden in the far reaches of the known world, but it is rumored that it was once visited by phaeacian explorers. The Daduchoi, the Erytheian mystics of the setting sun, might also have discovered the mythical gardens. Hesperides bring hope and health to the land in which they dwell.
