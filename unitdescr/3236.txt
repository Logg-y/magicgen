Myrddin is the most powerful mage in Man, and possibly in the world. Myrddin is a Cambion, a demonbred. His mother was an Avalonian witch that got seduced by an incubus demon. He was born aware and he was adept at witchery from birth. His mother’s sisters discovered the true nature of the child and confronted her. To protect the child the mother snuck him away and gave him to the monks of a monastery, where he was blessed, raised and educated. After a couple of years his mother approached him and revealed his legacy bit by bit. She taught him the basics of the Avalonian arts and witchery otherwise restricted to the witches of Avalon. In the monastery he was able to secretly study and practice until he came of age. By that time his skills far surpassed his mother’s and finally she told him who his father was. Myrddin was devastated, cursed his mother and left for Avalon to find the truth. When the witches discovered who he was they tried to capture him. He fled into the wild, where he lived for three score years. One day he discovered that his mother had been staked by the witches for giving him the arcana of Avalon. Since then he has appeared from time to time to give advice to the kings and rulers of Man to spite the witches of Avalon. Myrddin is able to change his shape into bird or beast and his demonic ancestry has granted him prophetic insights. Myrddin is secretive and tries to avoid the witches, so his lore and knowledge is mostly unavailable to the mages of the kingdom.
