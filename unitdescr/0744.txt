When the Inquisitors of Marignon sealed a pact with Infernal forces, there was no longer a need for Witch Hunters. Their place was taken by devil-worshipping Blood mages called Diabolists. Diabolists now travel the land searching for pure virgins for their vile rituals. The Diabolists summon imps and devils and bind them to servitude. Now palaces and temples are sometimes protected by devils, and the wealthy keep imp servants and demon jesters in their homes. The usefulness of the imps has made the population of Marignon ever more accepting of the diabolical cult.
