The Thaumaturgs were an order of mage-priests in the great empire of Ermor. They were skilled in the arcane lore of the Spheres, but were influenced by the darkness permeating the empire in its last days. With their lore of the stars and the laws of the Underworld they predicted a great cataclysm, and advised the twin brother of the Ermorian emperor to rebel. During the civil war that followed, Ermorian magic caused the great cataclysm that eradicated the empire. As Ermor fell, the Thaumaturgs changed their ways to stall the Reawakening of the Ashen Empire. They introduced a Death Cult that would make the dead serve the living. Apart from their priestly powers, the Thaumaturgs have skills in both Death and Astral magic.
