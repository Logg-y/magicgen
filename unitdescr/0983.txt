Deep in the Smouldercone, the warlocks of Abysia experiment with their brethren to create superior beings. The Humanbreds are the result of one such experiment. The Humanbreds breed and grow quickly, making them useful in warfare. They share the Abysian resistance to heat, but their flesh is cooler and they can wear leather armor. The Humanbreds are a blessing to Abysian society and serve as slaves and light infantry.
