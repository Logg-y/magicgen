When the last of the Oracles died their secrets were passed on to human mages. Foremost of these were the Necromancers, but other sages had arrived, exiled from the magophobic nation of Ulm. Unable to openly ply their trade, Alchemists fled Ulm and many ended up in Agartha. When they arrived to the great halls they found great mineral riches, but they also found the ancient lore and knowledge of the Pale Ones. Alchemists are sages who study transmutations of matter and essence. How different materials react to each other is important in alchemy. Ktonian Alchemists have little access to plants and animal concretions. Instead they focus on the attributes of minerals found in abundance in the deeper earth. The Alchemists have discovered Cave Fire, a highly flammable substance used by the Necromancers in warfare.
