During the Malediction, evil was let loose in the kingdom. The Hunger that the evil aroused resulted in cannibalism and practices even worse. Some of the warring nobles succumbed and became vampires who thirsted for human blood. Erzsebet was one of these nobles. She was past her prime when the the land was cursed. The Malediction spawned wicked ideas in her deranged mind and she convinced herself that the blood of virgins would make her young again. The influence of the Malediction gave her what she wanted and she discovered the secrets of blood. Ever since she has collected virgins to drain and bath in their blood. Recently she was summoned to a lavish feast where she was given all the blood she ever wanted. She pledged herself to the awakening god and has since served the Lord of the Malediction.
