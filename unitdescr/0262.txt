Vanheim is ruled by Vanir, a race of Elvish beings descended from forgotten gods of the distant past. They are far superior to humans in physical and magical strength. All Vanir are masters of illusions and tricksters of the mind. Their halls are hidden in mists and their soldiers take on false appearances at will. Vanir always ride into battle astride magnificent fay horses of unequaled speed. Vanir are sacred to the inhabitants of Vanheim and can be blessed.
