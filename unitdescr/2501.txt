When the previous Pantokrator claimed the world he bound entire pantheons of gods in the bodies of three dead titans. Each of the three God Vessels contain a legion of imprisoned gods merged together into an entity of vast powers. When the Seal was broken the God Vessels returned to the world to wreak havoc, but the Legion of Gods was still bound in the flesh of a dead titan. When the God Vessel was destroyed the entire pantheon of mad gods emerged with unfettered powers, leaving destruction, madness and grief in their wake. Hopefully the entity will leave the world for other planes of existence.
