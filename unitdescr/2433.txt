Utnapishtim is an ancient Enkidu blessed in primordial times by a servant of the previous Pantokrator. He was tasked with building a great vessel to save all living beasts from a great deluge brought upon the world by the Pantokrator. When the Pantokrator realized that his servant had thwarted his plans he imprisoned his servant, but forgave Utnapishtim and allowed him to live eternally. Utnapishtim has grown grumpy over the centuries and often complains about his immortal state of existence. He prefers to be left alone, but has come to believe that the Awakening God can give him solace and death eternal.
