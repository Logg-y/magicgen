The Titan of Winds and Waves is a giant of divine heritage. She was given authority and power over the winds and the waves by a previous Pantokrator, but she fell in love with mankind and taught them the secrets of sailing, ship crafting and trade. When the Pantokrator heard the prayers of sailors and tradesmen he realized that she had betrayed his trust and he punished her with eternal imprisonment. The Titan of Winds and Waves can bring men across the sea as well as into the sea.
