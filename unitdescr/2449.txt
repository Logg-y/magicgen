Shamans in training are always told to make a sacrifice to this sinister idol each full moon. Not doing so will make their magic backfire and they will be cursed instead of their intended target. Many shamans and witches have tried to skip the offering, but they always end up dead or cursed. Through the ages the Idol of Sorcery has accumulated a huge amount of offerings and it has grown in power so it can rival the mightiest of arch mages. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Idol of Sorcery has the chance of putting the world under its strong dominion and become the True God. Anyone who dares to strike at the Idol in close combat will be permanently cursed.
