During the Malediction, evil was let loose in the kingdom. The Hunger that the evil aroused resulted in cannibalism and practices even worse. Some of the warring nobles succumbed and became vampires who thirsted for human blood. Artur von Dirksen is one of these cursed nobles. Even before he was transformed into a vampire he had a sadistic taste for unfair combat. Equipping his servants with blunted weapons he staged arena battles where he could skewer his opponents without any real risk to his life. When the Malediction struck he was delighted to discover that his body had become impervious to ordinary weapons. He has since honed his skills and fed his sword the blood of men who cannot harm him. Most vampire counts can dominate human peasants, who become nearly mindless and serve their master as obediently as dogs.
