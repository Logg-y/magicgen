The Paqo is a shaman and priest healer of the Nazcan humans. Male shamans receive their calling by being struck by lightning three times. This is a sure sign that the mountain spirits have chosen them as tools. Through them the mountain spirits bring good fortunes to the humans. Considered heretics by the priests of Nazca they are still used for their skills in herb lore and medicine. The Paqo follow their own traditions and rarely share their magical insights with the Nazcan mage-priests.
