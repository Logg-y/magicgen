Orokestes became a temple servant at the age of five and was castrated like all male servants of the temples. At the age of fifteen, he tried to perform the secret Rites of Healing to restore his lost manhood. Orokestes was discovered and banished from the temple. He found his way to a cave of mystics where he was initiated, but he soon grew tired of their cave and strange rituals. He left the mystics to find other wise men. On this long search for knowledge, he learned much of magic, but he never found the means to heal himself. Finally, he found his faith and became the Hierophant, or priestly leader, of a group of mystics in the service of the Great Lord of Arcoscephale.
