The Erinyes are three horrible spirits of vengeance that punish those who slay innocent women. In ancient times they upheld the ban against Blood magic, but they have since returned to the darkness whence they came. The three sisters are dressed in dark or blood splattered robes and wield weapons of vengeance. Tears of poisonous blood stream from their eyes and their breath is unbearable. Their hair is full of poisonous serpents and they have wings of bronze. They are called the Kindly Ones, but their names are the Avenger of Murder, the Grudging Anger and the Unrelenting One. Tisiphone, the Avenger of Murder, sits by the Throne of Tartarus and her touch is doom.
