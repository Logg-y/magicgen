There are three clans of Caelians. The Caelians of the Airya clan were blessed in ancient times by the Mainyus of the cold winter and are resistant to cold. They were made guardians of the Sacred Fire of the White Forest. The Airyas make poor fighters. They are of lighter stock than humans and their wings make them slow in hand-to-hand combat. But the ability of flight has other benefits and makes Caelian armies quick and unpredictable. Their ice lances are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings and the magical ice in their ice studded armor tempers and hardens in cold provinces.
