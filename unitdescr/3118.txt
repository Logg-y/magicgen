The Elder Cyclops is an exalted giant of ages past. They were once taught the secrets of metalcrafting by the Telkhines. When the island of Telkhinis sunk beneath the waves and its masters were imprisoned in Tartarus, the Elder Cyclopes were spared in return for their services. But the celestial powers got tired of their servants and their crafts were all but forgotten. The Cyclopes found themselves lost and without purpose. Watching the lesser races they found a kindred race in the Gigantes of Mekone. The few surviving cyclopes settled in a volcano outside the golden city of Mekone and found purpose again. Now they forge armaments for an army to punish pretending gods.
