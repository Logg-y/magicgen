Ho Hsien-Ku is one of the Immortals, the ancient heroes of T'ien Ch'i who have attained a limited form of divinity. Ho Hsien-Ku was a young lady who dreamed that mother-of-pearl would give her immortality. Living on a diet of mother-of-pearl and moonbeams, she gradually turned ethereal and finally became an Immortal. Now she floats from mountaintop to mountaintop, collecting magical herbs. Her skill in healing is well known and she gladly helps wounded soldiers recover from their afflictions.
