Born at the dawn of time the Golden Lion represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. The Golden Lion is is a huge lion with golden pelt almost impervious to physical harm. It is believed to be the progenitor of the Kithaironic Lions. The monster ravaged the land of men and brought destruction and strife until the previous Pantokrator rose to power and imprisoned the beast for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Golden Lion is once more free to roam the bountiful lands of men.
