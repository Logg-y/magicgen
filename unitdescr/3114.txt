The Gerontes, elders, are members of the ruling council of a city. The gerousia is composed of elder Gigantes who once were in the military and any Lochos of exceptional skill is expected to one day be elected into the gerousia. The gerousia also perform the ceremonies and offerings to the god-slayer. As priests of the god-slayer they refute false gods. Through persuasion or coercion they have become good at convincing humanity of their follies. The Gerontes are skilled leaders, but tradition dictates that they only lead a limited number of troops.
