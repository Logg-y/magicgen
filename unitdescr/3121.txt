The Eldest Cyclops is the first of his kin. Once taught the secrets of metalcrafting by the Telkhines he was spared and shackled beneath a great volcano when the Pantokrator rose to power and shattered Telkhinis. For ages he was forced to forge artifacts for his master, but with the disappearance of the Pantokrator his shackles are weakening and the godly smith is now forging weapons to be used against pretending gods.
