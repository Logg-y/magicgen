All great religious ceremonies of T'ien Ch'i are performed by the Ministry of Rituals. The Ministry interprets heavenly signs and creates a cultic calendar each year. These calendars are distributed to the Ceremonial Masters who use them to perform the correct ceremonies and avoid disasters. The Ministers are priestly bureaucrats who travel through the provinces of the Empire and perform the ceremonies of the official calendar. Their predictions have a slight chance to influence events where they travel. The Ministers do not practice magic. They can be distinguished by their Imperial red robes and the fly whisk carried by those who serve the Ministry.
