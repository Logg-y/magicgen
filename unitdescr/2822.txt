Since the fall of Berytos Pelagian mermen have begun to trade with other cultures. The Sideraspides of earlier times were heavily influenced by Berytian soldiers, but now the military advancements of other cultures have made their way to the coastal cities founded by Pelagian mermen and their Berytians allies. While many nations have abandoned the use of bronze in favor of iron, the Pelagian mermen have gone the other way around. The iron armor of Berytian design has been replaced with heavy bronze hauberks modeled on Arcoscephalian armors. Bronze is in some ways inferior to iron, but it doesn't corrode when exposed to sea water. The mermen hoplites use Arcoscephalian formation tactics, but they are not as well drilled. The mermen of the coastal cities are often viewed with some suspicion and they do not have access to the superior training of the Wave Warriors.
