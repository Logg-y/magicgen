Unholy and horrible, the skeletal Knights of the Unholy Sepulchre serve the Bishops of Eldregate in death as they once did in life. They are armored in rusty plate hauberks and mounted atop skeletal horses in corroded barding. To behold a Knight of the Unholy Sepulchre is to face terror from beyond the grave and only those certain of their martyrdom will engage the Knights in combat. Like most undead, they will not rout unless all undead commanders are killed. The Knights are mindless and will quickly dissolve if they are broken on the battlefield.
