The priests of Eldregate were once responsible for performing the ceremonies of the Holy City of Eldregate. When the Dusk Elders succumbed to the dark lure of Death magic, the Arch Bishops sat idly by as they watched the Empire fall. As a result, they were more harshly cursed than the rest of the population and now perform the unholy rites of reanimation. The priests of Eldregate are surrounded by a wind of numbing cold.
