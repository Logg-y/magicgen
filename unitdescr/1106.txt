During the subjugation of C'tis, lizard soldiers were recruited into the Ermorian ranks. Lizard Auxiliares have since been a regular part of the Ermorian army. The lizards are armed as the Hastati, but wear ring mail cuirass of C'tissian design and use round shields instead of the tower shields standard to the Imperial Legions.
