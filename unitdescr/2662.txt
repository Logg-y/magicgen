When a priest or priestess dies the remains are mummified to keep their knowledge and wisdom for future generations. The Mallqui of a priest is more important than a regular noble Mallqui, but they do not always have a family to pay for their stipends. Instead the Sun King must pay their salaries. The Mallquis are led by the Royal Mallquis of the Silent Council, ancient mummies of vast powers. They are able to whisper silent commands to the dead and reanimate their bones. The embalmed priests gains foresight and oracular abilities uttered in silent sentences interpreted by the priests.
