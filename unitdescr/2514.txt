The Cave Crab resembles an ordinary crab, only larger than a horse instead of a lot smaller than one. It has a thick outer skeleton and one enormous claw that is capable of pinching through just about anything. The Cave Crab is usually not aggressive but wise beings leaves it alone as it scuttles along sideways in the caverns. The crab feeds mainly on fungi and dead cave beings, but if presented with the opportunity it might very well produce a few extra dead cave beings to feed on later.
