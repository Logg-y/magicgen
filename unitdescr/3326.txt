The Magnificent Kingdom of Ind has many subservient lands. Among them is Great Orionde, a forest kingdom ruled by noble men who have tamed the wild forests and their inhabitants. Great Orionde is a subservient kingdom allowed to keep their hereditary kings and there is no Viceroy of Ind to rule the land. The kings of Orionde revel in hunting of game and half-men. They are cruel and efficient masters and their half-men slaves often fear their masters more than they fear death.
