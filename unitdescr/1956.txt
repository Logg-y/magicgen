The Lady Midday is a malign spirit of the noon. She appears as a young girl surrounded by whirling dust and armed with a scythe that stinks of disease. Sometimes she will stop people and ask them a question. Failure to answer results in her displeasure and she will use her scythe to disease or chop off the head of the victim.
