The Haliades are sea nymphs, spirits born in the oceans at the dawn of time. They tend the kelp forests and underwater wildlife of Oceania. They serve as priestesses of the Awakening God of the Underwater Wild. Haliades manifest as beautiful mermaids riding Hippocampoi steeds. The Haliades are ancient manifestations of the sea and do not share the Oceanian affinity for change and transition between land and sea, and cannot leave their maritime realm.
