In the Siege of the Sacred City, the besieging forces summoned Red Devils to break down the walls and ravage the city. A company of samurai led by Hashi Saburo painted their armor red and snuck out during the night and butchered the sorcerers summoning the devils. The besieging forces thought that the devils had turned on their masters and were swiftly routed. The cavalry of the city was released and the besieging army was butchered to the last man. After this feat, Hashi's company took the name of the Red Devils. They are among the most well known and feared of the units at Jomon's disposal.
