At the dawn of time, monsters and giants roamed the world. Among the beasts was a monstrous dog that emerged from the Underworld to feed upon the dead. The beast made its home in the cave where the rivers of the underworld spring forth and it was worshiped by the first men as the Guide of the Dead and Guardian of the Underworld. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned the Dog in the cave and replaced him with a loyal and less monstrous Psychopomp. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the Dog of the Underworld is once more free to feed upon the dead and receive the prayers of fearful men. The Dog of the Underworld feeds on the dead and gains hit points if enough corpses are present.
