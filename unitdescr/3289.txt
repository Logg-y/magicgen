In Magnificent Ind every soldier is a priest and every noble is a king. But some Kings are exalted beyond their peers. The Primate Kings are the highest and most noble of all equals under the Prester King. They rule in all matters and celebrate the high masses when the Prester King is absent. The Primate Kings rule in all matters and are skilled in magic as well as military strategies. In any other land they would be exalted heroes praised by bards and minstrels. The Primate Kings drink from the Fountain of Youth and most of them have lived for centuries.
