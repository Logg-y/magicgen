When Eurymedon, King of the Gigantes, led his kin to war against the gods of men, his son Nausithous saw the folly of his ways and fled with a few followers to distant lands. Eventually the Gigantes who fled settled on Black Korkyra in the phaeacian archipelago. After a short conflict the Gigantes yielded and Nausithous offered himself in marriage to the Colossi Queen. The Gigante nobles have intermingled with the Colossi, but the remaining Gigantes follow the traditions of their Mekonean ancestry and follow their Lochos commanders. The Lochos arm themselves with ancient armaments crafted by the Elder Cyclopes during the heyday of the Mekonean Kingdom.
