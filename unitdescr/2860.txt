Soldiers of the Deep are martial initiates of a cult of the deep. They serve and protect the temples and the Witnesses of the Deep, preparing for the Atlantian conquest of the world. Soldiers of the Deep are taught the secrets of waterbreathing and are given coral spears as a sign of their devotion. They do not use shields, as this would be awkward when entering the promised land beneath the waves. They are devoted to the Atlantian cause and are often regarded as fanatics.
