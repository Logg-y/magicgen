The Gigantes of Mekone have enslaved their neighbors and much of their armies are comprised of human slaves, helotes. Coerced into military service these helote soldiers have abysmal morale, and fear rather than loyalty keeps them in line. However, the Gigantes are few and the humans are numerous and expendable, so helotes have been given armaments to serve in wars for a long time. Helote peltasts are given light armors and wicker shields. Helote peltasts rarely survive long enough to be promoted to neodamode status.
