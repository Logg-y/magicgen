Etimmu is a wraith lord who once lived in the land of the Sauromancers. He learned their secrets and used them to establish a kingdom of terror in a distant land. He gave himself the title of Priest King and made his people worship him as a god. Etimmu used his dark powers to summon Black Servants to aid him. The temples, towers and palaces were all filled with walking shades. Etimmu and his servants were finally slain by Udum'ukinna, the son of Ekishnugal, and his Sauromancers. Etimmu's blighted kingdom is still known as the Shaded Lands. Etimmu was given further power and immortality by the King of the Underworld. Etimmu rides a horrible, flayed spectral horse into battle.
