The Khlysty are religious fanatics who mutilate themselves and whip their bodies bloody. The movement of the Khlysty is a secretive one and the members practice their bloody rituals where they are not openly seen. However, the Khlysty are actively proselytizing and they often form small bands that travel into enemy lands and preach the word of God, often scaring the locals rather than converting them. A province that contains Khlysty suffers from unrest. Many Khlysty have mutilated bodies and suffer from various ills.
