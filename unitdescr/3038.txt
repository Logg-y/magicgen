In Old Pelagia, the Tritons were the undisputed rulers and their mages had access to resources and arcane lore inherited from the Triton Kings of old. After the civil wars much of the ancient legacy was lost. The mermen, who never were allowed to glean the magic of the pearls, turned to new and unimaginable magics, but the Triton Pearl Mages clung to their ancestry and preserved their ways even after the kingdom was torn apart. The Pearl Mages are adept in the paths of water and the stars and they are able to cultivate pearls imbued with astral magic.
