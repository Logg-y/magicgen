The Melqart is a prodigal Rephaite king who has left Hinnom to become the God of Berytos. Once the Rephaim all lived in Hinnom, but when the Berytians founded colonies near the city of Ashdod, they were influenced by the Rephaites and began to worship them as gods. The Melqart is huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from his forehead and his hands have six fingers. The Melqart is a descendant of Azazel and shares his gifts and appetites. With the Pantokrator gone, he is free to claim the world as his banquet.
