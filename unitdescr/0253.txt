The mages of Old Ermor performed rituals that corrupted and destroyed the old Empire. These mages are now summoned from the dead to wage war against the living and they are now known as Spectators or Dusk Elders. The mages do not possess solid bodies, but their spirits are connected to the Netherworld and their powers of Death magic are greater than ever before. The mere touch of these mages will drain the life energy of the target and replenish the power of the mage. They are ethereal and very difficult to harm without magic weapons.
