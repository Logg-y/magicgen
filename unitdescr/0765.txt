Serpents, large lizardlike predators, have been domesticated to replace the horse in warfare, because horses are very rare in Pythium. Since the Serpent Cult replaced the Theurgs, the Serpent Cataphracts have received tremendous prestige. They have replaced the Battle Vestals as Guardians of the Faith and have been declared holy in the eyes of God.
