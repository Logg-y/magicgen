Pisachas are Bandar apes cursed with insatiable hunger for flesh. They feast on the dead and inhabit cemeteries. Pisachas seem to be more numerous in or near Lanka and it is likely that apes are coerced or lured to partake in cannibalistic feasts that forever curse them with the Hunger. As they eat the flesh of dead humans and apes, their bodies and minds decay and transform. Pale and putrescent, they follow armies to feed on the dead and the dying. The hands of a pisacha are transformed into claws that stiffen the muscles of those it wounds.
