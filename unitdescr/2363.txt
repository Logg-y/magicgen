The Gloso or Glow Sow is a horrible dark boar with glowing eyes and razor sharp bristles on its back. They are surrounded by a hellish heat that can set vegetation and clothes on fire. They live in ancient dolmens or graveyards were they sharpen their bristles by scrubbing them against the gravestones. The Glosos fights by running at its targets and slicing them with the bristles on its back.
