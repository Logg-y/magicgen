Cynocephalians are dog-headed beast-men living in the lands of Ind. As subjects of Ind they are ruled by viceroys and vicomtes of the magnificent Kingdom, but they readily follow their own chieftains and warlords when called to wage war on the enemies of Ind. Once most cynocephalians wore hides and used weapons of wood and stone, but contact with Ind has led to advances in technology and now the chieftains and the rich use armaments of iron and wear linen clothing. Cynocephalians are as prone to plunder and pillage as the flesh-eating human tribesmen and only under the rule of the governor-priests of Ind are they kept under control.
