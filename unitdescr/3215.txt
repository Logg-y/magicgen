Since old times the Cyclopes of Phlegra have herded great mouflon sheep. Under the advice of the Oppressor Archons the Cyclopes have bred and trained the great sheep to carry human riders in an attempt to mimic the mounted tactics of other nations. The mouflon are not as fast as horses, but they are stronger and they can provide supplies for the army. Mouflon Cataphracts are slave soldiers and serve out of fear rather than loyalty. They have abysmal morale compared to the knights and cataphracts of other nations, but can be pushed to bravery by cruel taskmasters.
