Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land. Halfmen, like humans, have underwater counterparts. Ichtytaurs appear as minotaurs with fish tails instead of hind legs. They are wild beings that roam the kelp forests of shallow waters, not unlike the minotaurs that roam the woodlands on dry land. Ichtytaurs have strange abilities of transformation and can remove their tails to walk on dry land. On land they fight by charging through the enemy trampling anything that is smaller than themselves.
