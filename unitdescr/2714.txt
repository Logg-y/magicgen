The Bacabob are ancient Atlantians and descendants of the Basalt Kings who came with the flood. They are the undisputed rulers of the waterfilled caves of Xibalba. In the lost ruins of the Zotz they found murals and artifacts that spoke of arcane secrets. They unearthed the old dark magics of the Camazotz and allowed young Muuch sorcerers to study and practice the dark arts. Among the artifacts of the Zotz, obsidian weapons were found and with their ancestry the Bacabob were able to reinvent the secrets of obsidian crafting. With the imminent arrival of the Awakening God the Bacabob have coerced the last remaining Zotz into servitude. The Bacabob are masters of subterranean waters and are worshiped as water-divinities by surface-dwelling men.
