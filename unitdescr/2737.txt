The Immortal Coya is the dried husk of an ancient Nazcan queen that has mastered her own mortality. By removing her viscera and hiding it outside her body, her spirit was able to reanimate her remains before the Hurin priests were able to sacrifice her spouse and turn the couple into a mummybundle. As queen of the dead the Mallquis follow her command and the Hurin priests have reformed the cult to worship of the Queen Immortal, the Unbundled. The decomposition of her body has made her wings useless for flight.
