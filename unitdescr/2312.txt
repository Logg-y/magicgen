The awakening of the Vengeful Woods has altered the very essence of Asphodel's inhabitants. No longer are white calves born in the Sacred Groves. Instead, black centaurs are born, mirroring the dark mood of the forests. These black calves are trained as priests and guardians of the sacred groves of Asphodel, singing songs to please the Awakening God. Hierophants can affect carrion beasts with their prayers and have some skill in Death or Nature magic.
