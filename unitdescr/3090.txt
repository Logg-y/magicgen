When the apostles of U'an came to the broken Kulullu kingdom they were celebrated as saviors. For centuries the Kulullus had weathered constant attacks from Atlantians, Tritons and the wild beings of the kelp forests, and the gifts of U'an were almost lost. With the newly formed alliance with the Enkidus the Kulullus are gathering their forces and the ancient kingdom is mustering. Kulullu soldiers wear the scaled bronze armor used in the early days of the kingdom.
