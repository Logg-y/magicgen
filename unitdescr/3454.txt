A portion of the humans of Ubar live pastoral lives. Their caravans travel through the deserts to distant lands where they are met with wonder and disbelief. The camel caravans of Ubar are famous for their frankincense and marvelous goods from the Hidden Land. But the caravan riders are not just simple merchants. Swordplay is an important part of life and every member of a caravan is an accomplished warrior trained in mounted combat. Caravans readily raid unsuspecting victims, should their masters wish it. Falconry is popular among the desert tribes and many camel riders own a falcon.
