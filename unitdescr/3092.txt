The Kulullu kingdom came into being when U'an brought civilization and culture to the depths. Kulullu society is in many ways organized as the Enkidu society of the First City, but since the kingdom came under the pressure from other underwater races, the centralized government crumbled. With the alliance with the Enkidus the Kulullu are trying to reestablish the ancient order and kings and queens once more lead the Kulullu. The Kuliltu Queen is what the Entu is to the Enkidus, a mage-priest queen.
