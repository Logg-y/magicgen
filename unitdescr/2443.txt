The Teotl is a giant of divine heritage. Once a messenger and representative of the Pantokrator, the Teotl of the Sky was given the authority of the Western Sun and the power of thunder. During the rebellion against the Pantokrator he was bereft of command in favor of a blood-thirsty warrior deity who devoured gods and men. Protesting against the order of things and the carnage released upon the population of the land, he was punished with eternal banishment. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator, he has returned to reform the world in his image.
