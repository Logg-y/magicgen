The Anakim are pureblooded descendants of the Nephilim. They are deathly pale six-fingered giants with great horns and tremendous strength. They are considered semi-divine and sacred to the lesser Rephaim. There are three clans of Anakim. The descendants of Sheshai are tall of stature and easily angered. In battle their furious temper makes them almost invincible. Their ancestry has made them remarkably resistant to flames and they were instrumental in averting the Anathemants and their Tide of Fire.
