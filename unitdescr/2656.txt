The Aclla, Virgins of the Sun, are priestesses of the Sun and servants of the Sun King. They all come from the Hanan moiety and they are chosen for their beauty and the color of their wings. They are trained at the sun temples from a young age as messengers of the Sun King and keepers of the sacred flames. The Virgins of the Sun trace their legacy to the Seraphines of Caelum and their magic skills are similar, although their religious authority have diminished as the Hurin priests of the ancestor cult gained influence. The Aclla receive mummification when they die.
