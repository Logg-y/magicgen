When the Airyas fled from Caelum, they found refuge in the desolate plain of Ragha, where they had once fought the Turan people. The last of the Airya Iceclads protected the last of the Seraphs during the negotiations with the Turan Shah and they became guardians of the emerging priestly caste. The Iceclads soon adopted the Turan concept of the sacred Immortals. The Immortals, Zhayedan, is a sacred elite force of limited numbers, replaced only when one of their numbers is slain. While the Turan Immortals bring righteous wrath to the enemies, the Airya Iceclads became serene guardians of the sacred flames and upholders of the faith.
