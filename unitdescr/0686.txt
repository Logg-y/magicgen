The Hastati are legionnaires trained in the major cities of the Empire. They normally take the second rank, behind the Velites and will deal the first blow against the enemy. The Hastati wield short swords and javelins. They wear the lorica segmentata, a flexible armor of metal bands joined together, and carry a scutata tower shield.
