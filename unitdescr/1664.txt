This huge fish lives only in the deepest gorges of the ocean. When it hunts, it will light up its antenna to lure the prey closer. When the prey comes close, it opens its enormous mouth and swallows the prey whole. This works best against prey animals that are smaller than the monster fish, but it also has sharp teeth to use against the few really large opponents that can be found in the oceans.
