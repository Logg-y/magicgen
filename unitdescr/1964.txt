With the dilution of the True Blood, the pureblood Abysians feared that the old traditions might be lost to the Humanbred population. To preserve the old ways the slayers were incorporated in the sacred caste of the Anathemants and a Slayer Cult was formed. The Slayers were trained as priests and murder was declared a sacred act. But with time the pureblooded Abysians were not numerous enough to fill the ranks of the Slayer Cult. With the anticipated Awakening of God, Humanbreds have been accepted as Slayer Newts, sacred assassins.
