Deep in the Smouldercone, the Warlocks of Abysia experiment with their brethren to create superior beings. The Demonbreds are the most successful of these creatures. Part demon, part Abysian, they share the strengths and weaknesses of both. The Demonbreds are bound by their nature to serve their masters as slaves. Trained as Anathemants and mages, they can achieve great status and influence. They are fanatically loyal to their masters and are the most trusted and able of the Abysian mages. Demonbreds radiate the hellish heat characteristic of Abysians.
