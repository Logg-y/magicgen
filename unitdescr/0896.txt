There are three priestly orders in the Machakan society. The most common order of priests is the Eyes of the Lord. They are in charge of domestic affairs in the theocratic kingdom. They gather information from the people and enforce the laws spoken by the Voices of the Lord. Eyes of the Lord count as fifteen ordinary men when patrolling provinces.
