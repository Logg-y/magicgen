In the depths of Carnutes lives an ancient man of unknown origin. He is simply known as the One in the Woods or the Wanderer. No Druid has trained him, but he appears to be a master of the Druidic arts. He is often accompanied by wild beasts and seems to prefer their company to that of men. Animals in turn avoid attacking him, unless severely stressed. With the awakening of the God, he has reluctantly left his forest to aid the Druids of Carnutes.
