The Keres are daimones of the underworld and servants of the Fates. They rip the souls from those dying on the battle field and send them to the nether realms. They have a hunger for blood and unless bound by magic they will gladly wreak havoc among men. The Keres are invisible, but to those able to see them they appear as furious, winged women dressed in bloody garments. Their fangs and talons are imbued with the powers of the underworld and will harm the spirits of the dead.
