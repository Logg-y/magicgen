The Sequani are a very small tribe. They are peaceful and have long since given up warfare. In times of strife they have been able to use their good relations with more powerful tribes. The Sequani have become skilled in philosophy and astrology and many nobles of the tribe have some magical skill. Quite a few of these Stargazers later leave their homes to study the Druidic arts.
