Araburu-kami are malign and violent gods sent to Yomi for their bad manners. They resent their situation and often wreak havoc on the world of the living if they get the opportunity. Araburu-kami have demonic shapes, but can take the appearance of a noble warrior of extraordinary presence. However, if wounded they cannot uphold their human appearance and revert to their demonic shape. They are revered and considered sacred by the Oni.
