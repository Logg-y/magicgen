The Younger Cyclopes are a tribe of one eyed giants herding sheep on the gentle slopes of the Phlegran hills. They are violent and strong and are sometimes found in the armies of the Phlegran Tyrants. The Younger Cyclopes are not related to the Elder Cyclopes and have none of the latterâ€™s powers or crafting skills. They fight with great clubs and throw boulders the size of men.
