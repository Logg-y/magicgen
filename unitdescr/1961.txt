The Eparchs are the highest ranking priests of the reformed faith. They are the chief administrators of the great temples and rarely venture far from their city. By being close to one of the Grand Princes, the Eparchs often gather enormous wealth and influence. They rarely care to follow armies and strictly adhere to the doctrine that military might is for kings and spiritual power for the priests. Thus they never lead armies.
