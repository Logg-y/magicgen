When a Lizard King dies, his body is mummified and buried in a sacred tomb. The dead king is revered in death, as he was in life, and his mummified body is considered most holy. In order to build a dual empire of life and death, the Sauromancers have awakened the kings of old. The mummified remains of a Lizard King are brought from his sanctum and given false life and power over the dead. His priestly powers give him command over the dead as well as the living and can rival those of the Ermorian Arch Bishops of Eldregate.
