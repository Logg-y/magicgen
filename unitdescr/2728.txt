The Batab, axe-wielder, is a chieftain of the brown Muuch of the forests. Contacts with the Zotz of the forests have influenced the Muuch and the title Batab has become widely used. The Batabob lead small contingents of warriors and raiders, but are rarely given large armies to lead. In the forests the alliance between Muuch and Zotz is more equal and it is not uncommon for a Batab of either species to lead both Muuch and Zotz units.
