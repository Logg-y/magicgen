The Risen Oracle is an ancient Oracle of the Deep, hailed as the greatest mage of the ages. Upon death, his body passed through a number of dark rituals to preserve it. Now the auspices are right and the dark soul of the Oracle has reclaimed the mummified body. The Risen Oracle is immortal and can reform its body should it be slain. Being immortal, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood.
