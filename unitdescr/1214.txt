The Marverni tribes were the inventors of the chainmail armor. The nobles of the Marverni can afford to wear the expensive armor and have formed a warrior caste that rules the Marverni society. Noble warriors fight with broad swords and shields. Marverni noble warriors, like the common warriors, decorate themselves with enchanted bear tattoos.
