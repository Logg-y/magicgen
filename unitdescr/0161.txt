The Order of the Sauromancers is a secretive one and only after passing three rites of initiation is one considered a full member of the Order. In the last initiation, the Rite of Three Gates, a Reborn enters the Underworld and immerses himself in the black waters of that dark Realm. If he returns, he is given a crown and full authority as a Sauromancer. The Sauromancers discovered the secrets of dark magic in ancient times and the magic of Death was prudently practiced during these times. However, when Ermor stole the secrets of life and death and perverted them, the Sauromancers knew that swift destruction would soon follow. They decided to aid the priests of C'tis with advice and prepare the kingdom for the coming catastrophe. Sauromancers are very powerful Death mages with some skill in Nature magic as well as other magic paths. The immersion in the black waters of the Underworld gives them great resistance to poisons and almost impervious hides.
