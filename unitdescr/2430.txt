Ba'al Hammon, Lord of the Brazier, was probably the first Melqart to approach the Berytians. He transformed the bloody cult of Hinnom to suit his own interests and made the Berytians worship him and sacrifice to him alone. While humans were small, their blood was as rich as any he had tasted, and they were easy to intimidate and control. With the arrival of other Melqarts answering Berytian summons, he has grown ever more jealous and he will likely protect his city from Melqart tyrants and feast on their flesh as they would feast on humans. Recently he was approached by a demoness of vast powers, a Telkhine God-Queen from the shattered kingdom of Therodos. He took her as his wife and a great celebration was held at the great temple. Blood flowed in unprecedented quantities. But Ba'al Hammon has started to wonder. His demonic wife seems less and less interested in the great blood feasts, and she even advises against the old rituals. And he has found himself increasingly tired of the great ceremonies and blood feasts.
