The armies of ancient Therodos were vastly superior to their neighbors. Well-drilled hoplites clad in Telkhine iron conquered all lands that the God-kings would covet. When the Telkhine kingdom was shattered and drowned the skills of metalcrafting were kept by the Kaberoi guilds. Now, with the reemergence of Therodos, Kaberoi guilds once more make armors of plate for the soldiers of the kingdom. Therodian commanders are living human commanders recruited in newly-founded Therodian colonies.
