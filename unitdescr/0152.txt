As a Daughter of Avalon gains knowledge and responsibility, she is given three tests. When she passes them, she becomes a Mother and is given a green dress and religious authority. The Mothers are potent priest-enchantresses who travel the lands of Man searching for sites of magical power, guiding the common people in prayer and aiding commanders in battle. They are skilled at stealth and are able commanders in their own right. They are often accompanied by Wardens sworn to protect them. The Mothers, like all Witches of Avalon, are considered sacred by the populace of Man. The Mothers of Avalon are skilled in the magic of Air and Nature and many learn other arts on their travels. They can also use spellsongs once sung by the Sidhe of Tir na n'Og.
