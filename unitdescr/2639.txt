Zahak is the son of a Turan Shah. Spoiled and arrogant, he grew accustomed to an ostentatious lifestyle. Weak of character and convinced of his own excellence he was an easy target for the Daevic messengers of the destructive spirit. Approached by the messengers of the Lie he murdered his father and usurped his throne. His reign soon turned into a tyranny with arbitrary executions and sumptuous feasts. The wicked Mainyus made themselves cooks at his banquets and served meals of remarkable taste, a taste that caused a ravenous hunger. And arbitrary executions became more common. Zahak was given a kiss and a blessing by his chief cook. Soon two serpents grew from his shoulders. The Shah tried to cut them off, but they just grew back and bit him in the face. He was then approached by a Daeva masquerading as a physician and was convinced that the serpent heads would try to eat his brain, unless fed human flesh. Zahak promptly killed his servants and had his cooks serve them at a great banquet. Now the flesh-banquets of Zahak draw slave traders and evil men from near and far, and the court of the young Shah has become a bastion of wickedness.
