Kurgi, the Slave to Unreason, is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. The Slave to Unreason has emerged in the world several times in history and brought insanity and madness to entire kingdoms. It has strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack beings previously marked by Astral magic.
