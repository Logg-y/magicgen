While the Triton mages of the Pearl Clan are the most skilled mages in Pelagia, there are numerous other mages of lesser power in the kingdom. It is not uncommon for mermen to study magic and their ability to enter dry land has made them carriers of the secrets of the Closed Realm. When Berytos fell Pelagian Explorers tried to salvage Berytian lore on the Telkhines. With the final rest of Therodos they could find secrets the Berytian never were able to uncover. Berytian lore combined with new discoveries in the ruins of ancient Therodos has given the mystics newfound powers. But with power comes suspicion and envy. There is a rumor among the Pearl Mages that the mermen are plotting the downfall of the Triton Kings together with secret allies from the Closed Realm. The telesteria of the Closed Realm were ordered closed, and now all mystics are trained in the deeps to make sure they remain loyal. Mystics are skilled mages, but their study of Telkhine secrets is time-consuming and the initiation of new mystics is uncommon at best.
