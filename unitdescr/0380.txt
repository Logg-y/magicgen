Uru'gallu is a lizard of few friends. He has served as a mercenary in several kingdoms and never cared about the politics of the Lizard Kings. Recently, Uru'gallu became aware of the rise of the Pretenders and decided that if he was to live under the yoke of godhead, it would not be the yoke of a pink human god with xenophobic priests. Uru'gallu is tremendously strong and his scales are thicker than any known in C'tis. It is said that his mother mated with an alligator, but few actually believe it. He fights with his jaws and a morningstar of black iron that destroys the armor of those struck. He always wears black scale mail.
