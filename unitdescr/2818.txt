Tribal peoples of the wild follow their shamans and totemic spirits. The Bone Tribes are despised by other tribes as they have abandoned the animal spirits and turned to cannibalism and necromancy. Bone Tribe Beast Hunters are prominent warriors that have proven themselves by single handedly slaying a ferocious beast. Like other Bone Tribe hunters they adorn themselves in bone charms that give them some protection from malign magic.
