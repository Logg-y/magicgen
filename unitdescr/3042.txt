Out of necessity the ruling dynasty of Erytheia has adopted a practice of sibling marriages. The princes are trained in all aspects of governance, magic and priesthood from a young age. Only when they are married do they end their studies. Should the current king die, the queen marries one of her brothers or sons and they share power until one of them dies. The surviving monarch then marries another sibling or one of their offspring. Some of the royalty have shown signs of insanity and physical deformities. Most mystics claim that this is the workings of a malign force awakening in the deep and propose a conquest of the shattered lands of Old Pelagia.
There is fierce competition among the royal siblings and princes occasionally murder one of their brothers to advance their position.
