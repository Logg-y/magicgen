In the God Forest, monstrous spiders are caught and trained by Machakan sorcerers. These huge beasts carry the Black Hunters, sacred warriors in full plate armor. Should the Black Hunter die, the hunter spider will continue to fight those who slew its master. The hunter spider can entangle nearby enemies in webs.
