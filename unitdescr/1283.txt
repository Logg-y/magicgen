The Ice Crafters are Caelian craftsmen and mages of frozen Water. They make the magical ice used in Caelum. They build palaces and make armor and weapons as well as common tools. A few of them become Enchanters and forge other magical items as well. Ice Crafters use less magical gems when forging a magical item.
