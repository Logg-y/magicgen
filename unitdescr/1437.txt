In the deep caverns of Agartha, sight is of little use. Most Agarthans have developed partial darkvision, but some infants are born blind. They are considered blessed by the Lord and given rigorous martial and mental training in the temples of basalt and marble. Blindfighters orient themselves by supernatural means and can only be led by Blindlords or mages. Blindfighters don heavy plate armor and carry kite shields with disturbing eyes painted on the surface.
