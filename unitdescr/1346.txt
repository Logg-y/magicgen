The Colossal Fetish is a huge statue that has come to life from being worshiped for many hundreds of years. It is mindless and mostly does what its worshipers believe it would do. It punishes harshly and rewards sparingly. The Colossal Fetish is made of wood and would be difficult to destroy in combat.
