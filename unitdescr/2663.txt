The Royal Mallqui is a mummy bundle composed of a deceased Inca and his Coya. When an Inca or Coya dies, the other sacrifices his or her life so that they can be joined in death more closely than they were in life. The internal organs of the Inca are removed and replaced with gold dust and sacred resin. The Coya, being the  daughter of the moon, has her organs replaced with silver dust. The Royal Mallqui retains the combined powers and experience of the couple. These ancestral couples are the true power of the Nazca kingdom, but they rarely involve themselves in the matters of the state. Their priestly interpreters claim that the royal mummies trust in the abilities of the Sun King and his spouse, and as long as the Inca is satisfied with the state of affairs, there is no reason to change a working order. The royal mummies are kept at the Temple of the Sun and are rarely brought out of their tombs, since they would demand a high stipend just to visit the Sun Kings Palace for a day. With the call of the Awakening God more of the couples have been brought out for advice, and their stipends are taxing for the economy.
