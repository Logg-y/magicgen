This strange being is the spectre of a dead Starspawn that has been called back to this realm. The Void Spectre is highly attuned to the minds of those who are asleep. It can bring the wisdom of the stars to the dreams of entire nations. The Void Spectre is a skilled Astral mage, but its greatest power is the one that affects all dreams in a very large area around it. When the Void Spectre is in an enemy territory, it will bring insanity to both enemy forces and the general population.
