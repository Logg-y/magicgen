The Rephaim are descendants of the Nephilim, giants of almost godlike power who walked the earth ages ago. With the demise of the last of the Nephilim, the race of the Rephaim multiplied and degenerated. The pureblooded Anakim gathered in the cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon while the lesser Rephaim spread out to conquer the world. The Rephaim are not as pale as the Anakim and their horns are shorter.
