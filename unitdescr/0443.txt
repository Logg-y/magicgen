Star Children are part human and part Illithid, successfully cross-bred by the Starspawns of R'lyeh. These beings are smaller than Illithids, but share many of their traits. They have short tentacles where there should be a mouth and are able to blast the minds of lesser beings with their iron will. Star Children are trained as mages and are sent ashore as assassins to deal with the younger races. Star Children are amphibious.
