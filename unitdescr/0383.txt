An undead demon prince called or sent by the Lord of the Underworld, he is winged and shrouded in death, and will annihilate the living of this world to make it a realm of the dead. The Prince of Death is a master of Death magic. When he calls upon the lesser types of undead with rituals, the effect will be greater compared to mortal necromancers and he is protected by shadows from his Netherworld realm at all times. His only weakness is his bond with the Underworld, which makes it possible for priests to banish him from this world.
