A Carrion Lady is a dead dryad reanimated and given unholy powers by a Panic Apostate, who forces the soul of the dead dryad to rejoin its own moss-covered carcass. The carcass is entwined with vines and roots that have a life of their own. The Carrion Lady has retained some of her former skills in the use of Nature magic, but her priestly powers are corrupted. She has unholy powers over the dead and is able to create manikins by animating vines, roots and the bones of dead beasts.
