Tenebrus is the king of the Shade Lands, the dark waste between the Underworld and the lands of the living. Through his kingdom all dead must pass. When the Soul Gates opened, he answered the call and led his armies through into the lands of the living. Shades and shade beasts will sometimes spontaneously appear in his vicinity. Tenebrus is an unholy priest and can summon shadows and dispossessed spirits to his service.
