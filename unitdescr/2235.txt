Since the destruction of Kiriath Sepher, the City of Books in far away Ashdod, the sages and scholars of the city have scattered over the world. While the Talmai Anakim fled to the Twin Cities, some of the lesser Rephaite sages ended up in remote parts of the world. In Marignon, their size and strange traditions made them prime targets for the Inquisition. However, one High Inquisitor of the House of Fiery Justice recognized the remarkable skills of the Rephaites and allowed one family to survive and serve the House. Simeon ben Tabbai is the head of this family. As long as he serves Marignon, the remaining Rephaites are allowed to live. Simeon is a skilled mage and a remarkable researcher. He is easily one of the most powerful mages in the kingdom.
