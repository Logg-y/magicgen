The Niefel Jarls are the undisputed rulers of Niefelheim. They are ancient Niefel Giants skilled in the magics of frost and Death. Being direct descendants of the Rimtursar, the Niefel Jarls don't care much for the schemes of the Skrattir, who would replace them with their primordial ancestors. Instead the Niefel Jarls have accepted the guidance and advice of the Gygjas and their Seith.
