The Barbarian Kings brought the worship of ancestral spirits with them. Spirits of long-dead warriors and chieftains guide the living in war and peace. Ancestor Smiths are mage-smiths and warrior shamans of great renown. Sequestered in hidden mountain abodes, they forge wondrous items possessed by ancestral spirits. Once many tribes had their own smiths crafting the dark armor and hideous masks now used by the Ancestor Vessels. To be able to craft arms worthy of heroes one must have a heroic battle prowess oneself. Consequently, all Ancestor Smiths advance their martial skills to heroic standards with the aid of their ancestors.
