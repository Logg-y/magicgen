The Tyrants of Phlegra, like their mekonean predecessors, have enslaved their human neighbors. The Gigantes of Phlegra have spawned in ever greater numbers, but the helotes are still used to fill up the ranks of the Phlegran armies. Unlike the helotes of mekonean times the slaves of Phlegra don't have any prospects of promotion. As long as they fight for the Gigantes they can hope that their families are spared. Helote soldiers have abysmal morale and need to be whipped into coercion by Tyrants or human taskmasters in order to fight effectively.
