Bapu was the brother of a Bandaraja of Kailasa. Resentful of the Yakshas' dominance over the Bandar, he listened to whispering dreams of malice and soon succumbed to a hunger for power. Bapu gathered followers and led a bloody rebellion against his brother. But the Yakshas were too powerful for his Bandar warriors and the whisperers did not give him aid. The rebellion was defeated and the rebels were exiled from Mount Kailasa. Bapu led his exiles into the jungles and created a remote kingdom far from the meddling Yakshas. But without the spiritual guidance of the Yakshas, the exiles turned to barbarism, cruelty and cannibalism. The kingdom of Bapu became a place of horror. And then the Rakshasis showed themselves. Strangely familiar, the apes accepted their leadership and foul practices and soon they had become slaves in the land of the demons. Bapu ended up as the main dish at a banquet of gluttons, but was returned from the dead and hailed as the first Raja of Lanka's undead apes. Now he leads the dead as he once wished he had led the living. As a sign of his office, he was given an axe of hate and malice.
