The Ophanim, or Wheels, are angelic beings of the Celestial Sphere. They serve the Reawakening God as he chose to claim this world as his and proclaim His Glory. Unfathomable and otherworldly, they bear witness to the splendor of the Awakening God. The Ophanim appear as a brilliance covered by four wings, that when unfolded will reveal a wheel intersecting another wheel of gleaming brass. The rim of the wheel is covered by eyes of sparkling chrysolite and the being is surrounded by a blaze like that of the sun.
