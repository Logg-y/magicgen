The Monolith is a powerful spirit that inhabits a huge standing stone. The spirit cannot leave the Monolith, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and it is also magically powerful. In a physical battle, the stone would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.
