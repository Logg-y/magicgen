Ulfhednar are Jotun warriors enchanted with the magic of the Jarnvidjur. They are trained and armed in the darkest reaches of the Iron Wood. They fight with spears and wear enchanted wolf skins that allows the wearer to change shape into a beast-wolf. When the skin is bloodied, the wearer howls in pain and rage and is forced to take beast form. The blood magic of the skin gives the warrior regenerative powers and unrivaled ferocity. The wolf skins are only given to a select few deemed worthy by the Jarnvidjur.
