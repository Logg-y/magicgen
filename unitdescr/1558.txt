Tlahuelpuchi are bloodsucking witches capable of taking animal shape. They stalk villages in animal form and wait for newborn babies, their favorite food, to be left alone. When a tlahuelpuchi finds such a child, she transforms back to human shape and gorges on the blood of the newborn. Tlahuelpuchi can be persuaded to use their skills to get close to men of influence and assassinate them. They can perform a strange ritual in which they remove their feet and start flying. They use this ability to travel swiftly and far. Tlahuelpuchi are creatures of the night and have perfect darkvision. In animal shape their stealth is unsurpassed.
