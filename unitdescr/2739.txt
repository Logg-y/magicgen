Zotz, the bat people of Xibalba, breed quickly and have lifespans far surpassing humans. When their cavernous realm was flooded the remaining Zotz settled in the dense forests of the surface world. They multiplied and rebuilt their colonies. When the caverns dried up and the Muuch disappeared the Zotz returned to reclaim their old home. Exposure to surface-dwelling cultures has resulted in some military changes, but most Zotz Warriors fight unarmored. Zotz are sensitive to cold and go into torpor if exposed to cold climates.
