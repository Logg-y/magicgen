The Panageis, the All Holy Ones, are high priestesses of the new faith. With the arrival of the Sibyls and the orphic mysteries the Archousai of earlier times have been replaced by priestesses that reflect the will of the awakening God. With a close connection to the cycles of life and rebirth, these priestesses perform animal sacrifice to procure fertility and prosperity of the land. In every temple there is a chasm into which blessed animals are thrown to their death during the celebration of the Thesmophoria. Their rotting carcasses are collected by the priestesses and used in the rituals of death and rebirth.
