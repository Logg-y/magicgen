The wailing lady manifests herself as the spectre of a lady weeping in lamentation over the annihilation of the Ermorian Empire. The apparition is horrible to behold and her sorrow impossible to bear. Living beings drop dead at the sound of her wailing. Wailing ladies are ethereal and difficult to damage with non-magical weapons. They are unholy and can be blessed by the priests of Ermor. Wailing ladies are rightly the most feared of all the units at Ermor's disposal.
