Sorceresses of great renown have been trained in the legendary Blackrose Tower by an unknown entity since time immemorial. The Blackrose Sorceresses were once part of the same coven as the Wormwood Witches until the two groups declared war on one another. The original reasons for the enmity between them are known only to the mistresses of the covens. The Blackrose Sorceresses were among the first to dabble in cross-breeding and they still practice those vile rituals in the dungeons of their dark tower. The witches get additional freaks when casting cross-breeding.
