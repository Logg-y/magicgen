The Milesians conquered the land of the Tuatha together with the men of Man. While Man captured Avalon, the Milesians tried to conquer Tir na n'Og, the Land of the Ever Young. Unfortunately, the Tuatha left this world with all their secrets and lore. The Milesians became rulers of the Tuatha heartland and named it Eriu. They allowed the Fir Bolg to live and intermarried with them. Now most Milesians have some Fir Bolg blood in their veins. Milesians live slightly longer than ordinary humans and are somewhat resistant to magic. The Milesian monks follow the same tradition as the monks of Man, but they do not sneak around the countryside. They prefer to stay in their monasteries.
