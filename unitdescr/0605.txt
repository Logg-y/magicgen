The Son of Niefel is a frost giant descended from the old Rimtursar. The giant is sprung from the glaciers of Niefelheim, the Land of Eternal Frost. His beard is made of icicles and his shield and sword are forged from the purest ice. The Son of Niefel is constantly surrounded by an icy wind and Winter Wolves will come to his aid whenever he is in a cold province.
