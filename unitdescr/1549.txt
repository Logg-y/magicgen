Shuten-doji are mortal vampires of Shinuyama. They appear as tall old men with fangs and claws, dressed in robes. Shuten-doji can produce enticing music with their flutes. They use this power to make visitors fall asleep so they can feast on their blood. Shuten-doji are feared by most Bakemono and the Bakemono Kings use them as commanders of their armies. In battle they use their enticing flutes to defend themselves from would-be attackers. Shuten-doji are not undead and cannot be banished by priests.
