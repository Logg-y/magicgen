The captains of the Phoenix Empire proudly present their Telkhine legacy by coloring their armor and clothing with the purple dye of their ancestors. The Telkhine heritage is also obvious in the sailing and boatbuilding skills of the empire. To become a commander in the Berytian armies, one has to be an accomplished boat captain and navigator. If you cannot command a ship you are of no military use.
