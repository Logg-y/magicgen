The Gannag Menog is the hypostasis of Angra Mainyu, a celestial being of great might. During the reign of a previous Pantokrator, the Angra Mainyu and his Ahura twin were banned from this world. Now with the Pantokrator gone and the old decrees weakening, the Angra Mainyu has found a way to manifest his spirit as a messenger of corruption and lies. Eventually he will reenter this world and claim it as his own. The Gannag Menog is a spiritual being, able to appear wherever it wants. It commands the Daevic Heptad, six demonic manifestations of the Angra Mainyu.
