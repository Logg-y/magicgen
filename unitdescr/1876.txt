Throughout the Empire, mystery cults have spread and flourished with the influx of foreign culture. One of these, the Serpent Cult, has replaced the official state cult of the Theurgs, but many others ply their trade in secret. The Cult of the Great Mother is very popular among women and most of the members in its higher ranks are female. The Mystes is a low ranking member of the Cult of the Great Mother. The liturgy of the mystery cult is heavily influenced by the Arcoscephalean priestesses, but the Mystes are not initiated in the art of healing. Unlike her elder sister, the Epoptes, the Mystes doesn't initiate others into the Cult. She wears a garland and a green dress. The Epoptes and Mystes are secretive and do not share their wisdom with outsiders. This makes them rather poor researchers.
