Equipped with mace and plate cuirass, the Battle Deacons carry out the will of the Pythian God on the battlefield. They often accompany and bless the serpent cataphracts and the hydras, but their priestly authority is somewhat limited. They are blessed by the God and are somewhat resistant to the noxious fumes of the hydras.
