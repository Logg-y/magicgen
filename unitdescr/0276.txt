Javelinists are light infantry units armed with axes and javelins. The strength of the giants allows them to throw javelins almost as far as a normal short bow would fire. Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning bolts.
