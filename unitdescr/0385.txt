The Neteret is a giant of divine heritage. A previous Pantokrator gave her powers of creation and she brought joy and fertility to the world. When the Pantokrator became aware of the rebellion of lesser gods, he imprisoned her and the world was bereft of Joy. With the Pantokrator gone, her imprisonment has ended and fertility and happiness have returned to the world.
