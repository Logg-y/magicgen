Eagle Warriors are sacred warriors who don feather cloaks. They wield spears and daggers, but wear no armor. When blessed, the sacred cloaks give the Eagle Warriors the ability to fly. The blessing of flight is useful in battle, but does not last long enough to allow the Eagle Warriors to fly between provinces.
