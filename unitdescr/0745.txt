After the fateful bargain with the Infernal Lords that led to the destruction of Ermor, the Goetic mages have maneuvered to gain vast political influence in the kingdom. Feared by all, the Goetic Masters perform the horrible rites that keep the Infernal Lords satisfied. But the Goetic Masters are not entirely free. The Inquisition keeps a close eye on the ceremonies and only at Devils-day is the public allowed to witness the sacrifices.
