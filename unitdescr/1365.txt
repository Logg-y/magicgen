Ceremonies and parades are common in the sacred kingdom and gilded, lizard-drawn chariots can often be seen in the Temple City. The chariots are used in warfare as well as in parades. With scythed wheels, the chariot is mainly an offensive weapon. Its charge causes tremendous damage to lightly armored troops. Lizard charioteers are armed with falchions and wear scale mail cuirass.
