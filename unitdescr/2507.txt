The Defenders of the Halls are pale ones equipped with short swords and kite shields of human design. Trained by human weapon masters they have become remarkably skilled and are entrusted with the defence of the deeper halls of the kingdom. They receive a bonus when defending castles. While their armaments make them superior to most Pale Ones in combat, their equipment is unwieldy and difficult to use under water.
