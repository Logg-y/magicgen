The Chilan is a Xibalban priest of the caves and the dark. They are the most numerous of the Xibalban priests and they administer the temples scattered throughout Xibalba. Through necromancy and geomancy they predict events to come and guide the Ajaws with their advice. They sometimes perform blood sacrifices, but normally this is left to the Ah Nakom or the Ajaws. The imminent conquest of the surface world has led some Chilan to fear that their influence over the Zotz will be lost. If it is a true prediction or just the fear of change is yet to be known.
