The Oracles are ancient Pale One mage-priests seated upon thrones in the Halls of the Oracles. They rule the Pale Ones with wisdom and precognitive powers. With the advent of the New God, they have foreseen Agarthan dominance of the surface world and are preparing their subjects for the conquest. In the Halls of the Oracles their perpetual council decides the fate of the world. The Oracles are divided into three orders. The Oracles of the Dead commune with the spirits of the past to gain insights of the future. They also interpret the carvings of the Seal and protect the Pale Ones from its influence. Recently some Oracles have tried to bind Umbrals to use them in the War under the Sun.
