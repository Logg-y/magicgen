Koschei is an evil, shriveled and senile old man who has terrorized young women since time immemorial. Ages ago he was a handsome and wicked man obsessed with young women. When he became older he lost his potency, perhaps through the curse of an angered vila. Desperate and full of hate, he searched for and found the hut of Baba Yaga. He tried to coerce the ancient witch into giving him longevity. She cackled a laugh and taught him the magic of Death. Koschei triumphantly left the hut for new conquests, accompanied by a whispering laughter. He hid his soul in a needle, which is in an egg, which is in a hare, in an iron chest, under an oak, on a distant island in a far away ocean. As long as the needle is unbroken, Koschei cannot die. But he does not become younger. Koschei had been taught the secrets of Death, but not the secrets of Life. Koschei is still impotent, still hateful, still senile. And he still captures young women, hoping that he will find one who will cure his impotence. With promises of a cure to his affliction, Koschei has agreed to aid the New God. Ages of solitude and lack of human warmth have made Koschei a being cold of heart. So cold are his emotions that he is constantly surrounded by an icy wind.
