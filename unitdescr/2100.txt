The Shikome are hags of the underworld. They are sent to hunt down those who try to escape the Land of the Dead. They appear as mad, starving hags with claws and pointy teeth. Their claws are able to harm and incapacitate ghosts and spirits. Shikome are never given food by their cruel lords and they all have an insatiable appetite for the food of the living. They take every opportunity to feast on flesh or fruits unavailable to them in the halls of the Underworld. Shikome are the personal servants of the lords of the Underworld and are revered by the Oni.
