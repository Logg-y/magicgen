Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land. Both humans and animals have underwater counterparts. Tritons are the most common of the aquatic humanoids. They appear as humans with legs ending in fins. The Amber Clans are secretive orders of Triton aristocrats led by mages and priests who serve the Triton Kings. The Amber Mages forge strange amber armor for their guards and the nobles lead armies for their kings.
