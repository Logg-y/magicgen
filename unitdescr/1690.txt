The Living Pillars are sacred guardians of the Basalt City. They are equipped with turtle-shell shields, enchanted basalt spears and incredibly heavy basalt armor enchanted by the Basalt Kings. The Living Pillars stand guard at the five gates of the city and could easily be mistaken for statues, were it not for their glowing antennae. The Living Pillars are rarely seen outside the city and when they are, they are most likely accompanying a Basalt King or Queen.
