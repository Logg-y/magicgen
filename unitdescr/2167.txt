The Shamans were once the spiritual leaders of the Enkidus. With the founding of the First City they have lost much of their influence, but their magical powers are undiminished. The Shamans despise the new ways and prefer to live pastoral lives far away from Eridu. Enkidu Shamans are powerful mages of the wild and the earth, rivaled only by the Panii of Pangaea.
