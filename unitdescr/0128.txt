After the fall of the Raptor clan the Spire Horn Caelians have become the martial clan of the magocracy. The Caelians of Spire Horn Mountain trace their lineage from the Kavi heroes of old, blessed by the Mainyus of the wind and storms. They have partial resistance to cold and lightning.  The Spire Horn Caelians are known for their skill in marksmanship. Archery is much preferred over melee combat and most of the Caelian army is comprised of quick and efficient archers.
