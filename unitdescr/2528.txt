Since time immemorial pale amphibians with external gills have lived in the watery caverns of the deeper earth. Some claim that the Olms are an earlier form of the Pale Ones. When Olms grow old they grow large and wise and whatever their origin the Pale Ones of Agartha revere them and consider them sacred. For ages the Olms have lived apart from the Pale Ones, curiously observing the emerging civilization from their underground streams and ponds. Sometimes Olms have been summoned by Agarthan mages. Olms communicate wordlessly and can project images and emotions to other sentient beings. This power can also be used to overwhelm and harm an enemy.
