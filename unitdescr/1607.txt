The Yazatas, or 'Adorable Ones' were semi-divine beings of an earlier age and the ancestors of the Caelians. Their power was broken by the previous Pantokrator and most fled to the Celestial Sphere ages ago. Yazatas arm themselves with spears and bucklers and don enchanted golden armor. Yazatas are attuned to the air and are able to fly during storms. They are sacred to the people of Caelum.
