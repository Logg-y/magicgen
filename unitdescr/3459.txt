A portion of the humans of Ubar live pastoral lives. Prominent caravan leaders are respected by the pastoral humans and lead the humans in trade and raids, but they rarely commit their men to full scale wars. The Caravan Leaders can send their couriers with goods and treasures home to their Lords from faraway lands. Falconry is popular among the pastoral humans and most Sheikhs own at least one falcon.
