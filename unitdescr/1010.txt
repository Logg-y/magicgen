The Svartalf is a dwarf of sinister nature. Like all dwarves, they shun the daylight and prefer to live in deep caves to work their wonders. The Svartalfs have fled the advance of man and found refuge in the hills near GnipahÃ¥lan where the dead pass by and the Hangadrotts reign. Svartalfs are old practitioners of dark magic, but not as skilled mages of the Earth as their dwarven cousins.
