The Kohen is a Gittite priest and keeper of traditions. Since the demise of the giants, the Old Cult has become ever more important. To keep the human population in line, the Cult was institutionalized and centered at Gath. All lesser temples were destroyed in favor of the Great Temple and the human population is herded to Gath once a year to witness the ceremonies and sacrifices to the Lord. The Kohanim administer the ceremonies and serve the Kohen Gadol. With the discovery of human potential, blood sacrifices have begun in earnest and the Kohanim travel far and wide to gather blood slaves for the great ceremonies.
