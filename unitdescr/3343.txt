While most Jann live comfortable lives served by slaves there are some who pursue a martial career. The Jann Emir is a Jann Noble and a commander of the sacred guard of Jannah. The Nobles of the Queendom are blessed with supernatural powers and are innately skilled in Air and Fire magic. They are regarded as semi-divine by the human and 'Adite population. Being semi-divine the Jann don't concern themselves much with religious affairs, but their subjects expect them to be religious leaders and the Jann Nobles have found themselves being regarded as priests, even though the 'Adites and humans have other, more dedicated celebrants of faith.
