The Wardens of Avalon are the sacred guard of the Witches. They wear green cloaks over full chainmail armor and wield great swords. The Wardens are exceptional warriors enchanted by strange magic to give them unequaled strength, resilience and morale. Rumor has it that they are descendants of the Tuatha. Wardens are sacred and can be blessed by monks or priests.
