The Celestial Servant is a gardener or servitor of the Celestial Sphere. It has the appearance of an obese pig-man. Celestial Servants are very strong, but not very skilled as warriors. They arm themselves with rakes and do not wear armor. Celestial Servants do not need the food of this world to survive, but they do love to eat and they have huge appetites. One Celestial Servant will eat as much food as seven ordinary men. They are sacred and can only be summoned by the Celestial Masters of T'ien Ch'i.
