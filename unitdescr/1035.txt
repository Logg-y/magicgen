Burkhard Nachtzehrer was known as a brute and a butcher. During the civil war, barons and counts were able to make their own petty kingdoms where they alone made and enforced the law. By fear and force, Burkhard made himself powerful. By draping his army camp with the entrails of captured soldiers, he convinced his enemies to flee before battle. His subjects fared no better. Blood sports and grisly executions were held in his castle for amusement. The very soil became dark and malicious. When the Malediction struck, Burkhard gave in to the Hunger and drank the blood of his remaining serfs in a feast that forever changed him into a beast of the night. Now Burkhard has reemerged from his castle to butcher the enemies of the Dark God.
