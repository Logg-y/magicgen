U'an is the first of the seven sages, the fabled Apkallus that brought civilization to the Enkidus. He so liked Enkidu-kind that he gave up his immortality and stayed in this world when his mission was done. U'an inaugurated the first Ensi and made the construction of the House of Water possible. His gifts of civilization and culture are beyond counting. Literacy, religion and agricultural advances are all attributed to the Apkallu. U'an represent the Wise Water and he wears a Fish-cloak with a dorsal and a caudal fin complete with a Fish-head mitre.
