The Teotl is a giant of divine heritage. He was once in charge of bringing rain and fertility to the world and as such, he was one of the most important servants of the previous Pantokrator. But he defied his lord and gave fertility for blood. The Pantokrator feared that his servant would grow powerful on his bloody diet and imprisoned him for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, the Teotl of Rain is finally free to drink blood from the vessel that is the world.
