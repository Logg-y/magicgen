The tribe of Iassachar is a small tribe known for its wisdom. They are prudent to the point of cowardice. They rarely fight, but many of them have become renowned scholars and sages. While women rarely become scholars, a few have learned the Sibylline arts of Arcoscephale. Whether their skills come from contacts with Arcoscephale is debated, and the Sibyls themselves claim to use lore revealed to them millennia ago. Since there were no humans inhabiting Gath at that time, their claims are refuted by most scholars.
