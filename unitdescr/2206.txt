Eldest among the dwarves, this dwarf has become the most skilled smith of a people of skilled smiths. Together with his younger brother he mastered art of artifice and magical forging. The two of them acquired great knowledge of magic through the centuries and their skills were unsurpassed. But the younger brother didn't have the proper mindset to become a true master smith, and with passing centuries the eldest dwarf surpassed his younger brother in all but pride. One day the younger brother stole most of their collected treasures and fled into the wild. There he transformed into a Linnormr to protect his stolen treasures. The eldest dwarf tried to regain his stolen gold, but the dragon was too powerful. Instead he forged magical weapons and gave them to the heroes of men so that they would slay his brother. Recently he gave up his of schemes of vengeance and decided to turn his crafts to a greater challenge. He would craft himself a godly mantle and claim the world as his.
