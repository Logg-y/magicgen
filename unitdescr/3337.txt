The 窶連dites are a tribe of Avvite giants that originate from the lands of Hinnom. To avoid the oppression of the Rephaites they fled into the deserts of 窶連d where they encountered the last of the Jinnun and formed an alliance. When the power of Ubar waned the 窶連dites became more influential and now the human Nabaeans serve the 窶連dites as they once served the Jinnun of Ubar.
