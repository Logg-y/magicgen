Lord Ruthven is a noble of unknown origin who recently appeared in Chelms. He is obviously well traveled and has extensive knowledge of distant lands, Ulm in particular. His wits and handsome appearance has made him popular among the noble women of the royal court, but the Judges and Magisters Arcane have become increasingly suspicious of him as he has appeared in a number of investigations of grisly murders. Ruthven successfully avoided the Judges for quite a while. When he was finally caught and brought to justice he called for the bishops and unexpectedly pledged himself and his strange powers to the cause of the awakening lord. He was spared and released, but there are still Judges who would have him put to the stake.
