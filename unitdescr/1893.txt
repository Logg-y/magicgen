Geomancy and the correct placement of buildings, armies and items of importance has become an obsession within the Empire and most Emperors have acquired the services of a mage adept at these things. The Imperial interest in geomancy has increased the prevalence of such mages and they can now be found in most larger settlements. The more prominent ones are recruited by the Ministry of Magic to serve the Bureaucracy. Geomancers have some skill in Earth and Astral magic and they have a slight chance to prevent bad events. They are armed with a bamboo rod used in their geomantic arts.
