Umor, the Eater of Gods, is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. The Eater of Gods primarily targets Pretender Gods as they provide much more more emotional sustenance than mere mortals. The Eater of Gods has emerged several times in history and slain the gods and exalted spirits of the time. It has strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack gods previously marked by Astral magic.
