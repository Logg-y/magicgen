No cynocephalian tribe has developed a reputation as those of Gog and Magog. Being the largest and most savage of all cynocephalian tribes they are the true power behind the victories of Magnificent Ind. While Magog is dominated by the bloody practices of their Bitch-Mothers, the tribe of Gog field the most well equipped warriors of all cynocephalians. The Gog Reavers have adopted the fighting style of the Fommepori cannibals, but the Reavers are larger, stronger and more savage. Few opponents can withstand the Reavers of Gog. Gog Reavers are exceptionally efficient plunderers, and cause unrest and widespread panic in the lands they visit. Gog Reavers use scale armors given them by the viceroys and governors of Ind.
