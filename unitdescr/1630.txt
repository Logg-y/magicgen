The Arssartut get their name from the restless dead thought to play ball with skulls of the dead. The Arssartut are sacred guardians of the bone fields of the Forsaken Coast. They serve the Awakening God and arrange the bones in divine patterns. Arssartut craft armor and weapons from the sacred bones. Their bone glaives are holy and filled with the power of the Awakening God, draining the strength of anyone wounded by them.
