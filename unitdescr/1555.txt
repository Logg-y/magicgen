Elephants, the largest animals known to man, are trained for use in battle. Their sheer size allows them to trample soldiers and horses. Elephants are intelligent beings with minds of their own. Once hurt, they become enraged and terrified, seeking to leave the battlefield by the shortest possible route and trampling friends and enemies alike.
