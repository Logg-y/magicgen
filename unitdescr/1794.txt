Tuan is an ancient sage and the last surviving Partholonian. When the Fomorian plague struck his people, he alone managed to survive. When his proud race fell to extinction, he hid in the shapes of stag, bear, eagle and salmon. Through the ages he has found the means to fully cheat death and lives to tell of the fate of the Partholonians and the Fomorians. A humble man, he serves the kings that be and avoids the burden of leadership in favor of scholastic tasks.
