The Drakaina was once a Titaness, beautiful beyond belief. When she spurned the previous Pantokrator she was cursed with a hideous form and was imprisoned on an enchanted isle. She now appears as a woman with the lower part of a huge serpent. From the serpent grow six dogs that hunger for human flesh. For millennia the baying of the dogs have frightened sailors that mistakenly have come too close to her island prison. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, her shackles are weakening and the Drakaina will avenge her millennial imprisonment.
