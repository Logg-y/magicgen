The Carnutes live in the great Wood of Carnutes. Here the druids gather annually. The Carnute warriors are well known for their wild and aggressive demeanor. All Carnute warriors are able to go berserk if wounded in battle. Like the Marverni, the Carnutes rarely use expensive armor. They fight bare-chested with axes and shields. Carnute warriors decorate themselves in tattoos. The Gutuaters of the tribe instill the tattoos with wild magic and can awaken the powers of the enchanted tattoos in battle. The Carnute tribe are known for their boar tattoos.
