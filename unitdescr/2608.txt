The Azi is the progeny of the Destructive Spirit. It is a three-headed dragon sprung from corrupted flames. When the previous Pantokrator banished the Daeva of Daevas, his offspring was imprisoned lest the world would be destroyed. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles of the Daevic Dragon are weakening and the Marshal of Destruction shall once more lay the world waste in ashes.
