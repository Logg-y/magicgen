When the Airyas fled from Caelum, they found refuge in the desolate plain of Ragha, where they had once fought the Turan people. The Airyas are considered calm and peaceful, but while the warlike Turans comprise much of the armies of Ragha, there are also Airyas who take up a martial life. Most of these become archers, but some of them fight in the old Caelian way, swooping down from the skies with their ice lances.
