The Triton kingdom of Pelagia was torn apart in a civil war. While the ruling Tritons battled each other the mermen withdrew and eventually founded Erytheia, the Red Land. Now the mermen have reclaimed the seas of Old Pelagia and Triton nobles are allowed to rule the old provinces as governors and administrators. There are still only a few mermen in Old Pelagia and Tritons make up most of the underwater population, as well as the armies.
