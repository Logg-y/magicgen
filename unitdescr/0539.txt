Rago is a young and very strong Warlord. He has been trained as a Lava Warrior but has since fought his way to Warlord status. He is a hero among the Lava Warriors and is rarely seen without a guard of his former friends. Rago is called the Rage Lord, a title given to those rare Lava Warriors who survive long enough to become Warlords.
