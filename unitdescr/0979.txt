The Great White Bull is a divine bull that has wandered the world since time immemorial. The bull has long been worshiped as a manifestation of the wildness and fertility of Nature and his fury and potency are unrivaled. Now that the Great One has fallen, the bull's ferocity drives him to lead his people to trample the thrones of the world beneath his cloven hooves. The potent fertility of the White Bull generates extra supplies.
