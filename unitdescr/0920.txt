Recently deceased warriors unnaturally animated into a state of false life, soulless warriors are armed with the weapons they died with. Soulless do not have any vital organs, but their bodies are in a state of decomposition, so they are easier to destroy than a wight or a lich. Soulless are often called zombies. They do not rout unless their master is killed. The soulless are mindless and will quickly dissolve if they are broken on the battlefield.
