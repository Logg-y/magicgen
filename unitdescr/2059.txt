The Avvim have been taught the arts of war and weaponcraft by the Grigori. The archers of Hinnom are tall and strong and able to use bows of great size and power. The archers are given heavy armor designed to protect them from incoming missiles. The weight and encumbrance of this armor makes them unfit for melee fighting. The great bows and heavy armor allow the Avvite archers to outshoot the missile units fielded by most nations.
