Yama-no-kami are mountain gods and protectors of the wild. They are powerful spirits as cold as the peaks they rule. Only rarely do they concern themselves with lesser beings. They command natural phenomena, weather and beasts in their realms and might help or destroy the occasional wanderer. Yama-no-kami very rarely leave their lofty abodes and would lose much of their powers if they did.
