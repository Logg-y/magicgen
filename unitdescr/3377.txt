The Prester King is the most magnificent king alive. Having lived for centuries he has guided Ind to greatness beyond any other kingdom. The Prester King was chosen from the ranks of the most glorious of the prelates of the kingdom. When he was asked to take the royal mantle he three times humbly declined. So great is his piety and modesty that he would not accept until all the priests in the kingdom begged him to don the Crown of Overmight.
