Since the Melqarts left the earth and were trapped in Sheol, the Nephilim-worship transformed into ancestor-worship. Deified kings of old are at the center of the cult and the old blood feasts have become ritualized banquets for the dead. The Zamzummim, the Murmurers, Rephaite sorcerers and shepherds of the dead, preside at the cultic funerary festivals.
