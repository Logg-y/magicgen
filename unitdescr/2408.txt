Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land. Halfmen, like humans, have underwater counterparts. Ichtysatyrs appear as satyrs with fish tails instead of legs. They are wild beings that roam the kelp forests of shallow waters, not unlike the satyrs that roam the woodlands on dry land. Ichtysatyrs have strange abilities of transformation and can remove their tails to walk on dry land.
