The longevity of the Emperor is of utmost importance, not only to the Emperor, but also to the Ministers and eunuchs serving under him. Should the Emperor die, many of his most loyal servants would follow him to the grave in the ensuing power struggle. The Emperor has many concubines and has sired hundreds of sons, all with more or less rightful claims to the throne. Thus the Ministers do whatever they can to keep the current Emperor alive. The most skilled alchemists of the Empire are invited to serve the Emperor with their skills in return for alchemical equipment, gold or luxuries. The Imperial Alchemists have uncovered the alchemical properties of all Five Elements and are able herbalists. They have gained longevity, poison resistance and the ability to cure diseases as well as the skill to alchemize gems into gold more effectively. The success and lifespan of an Emperor is more or less dependent on how well he treats his alchemists.
