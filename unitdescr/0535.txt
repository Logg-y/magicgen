Longdead archers are skeletal warriors of ancient times, reanimated to do battle against the living. They have been equipped with magical bows fueled with their hatred for those who slew them. When fired, the arrows will burst into the green flames of banefire that will cause the flesh of those burnt to rot and shrivel. The longdead are skilled, but their bones are brittle. They do not rout unless their master is killed. The longdead are mindless and will quickly dissolve if they are broken on the battlefield.
