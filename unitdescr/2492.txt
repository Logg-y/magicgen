Since time immemorial pale amphibians with external gills have lived in the watery caverns of the deeper earth. Some claim that the Olms are an earlier form of the Pale Ones. When Olms grow old they grow large and wise and whatever their origin the Pale Ones of Agartha revere them and consider them sacred. For ages the Olms have lived apart from the Pale Ones, curiously observing the emerging civilization from their underground streams and ponds. But this changed when one of their numbers befriended Emberstream, an Agarthan Oracle of Subterranean Waters. Deepthought, oldest and wisest among Olms had previously only been encountered on rare occasions. When Deepthought allied itself with the Pale Ones, so did its kin, and now the Olms of the deeper earth and their Sages aid the Oracles of Agartha. Olms communicate wordlessly and can project images and emotions to other sentient beings. This power can also be used to overwhelm and harm an enemy.
