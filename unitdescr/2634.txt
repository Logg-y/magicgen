Once the Caelian peoples were under the rule of divine beings known as Yazatas and Daevas. When these lesser divinities threatened the world with their never-ending war, they were banished by the Pantokrator. The worship of the Yazatas remained, but the Daevas and their rulers were abandoned and all but forgotten. But some unscrupulous sorcerers try to circumvent the ban and summon the divinities of old to lead the nation to world dominance. The most powerful of the ancient Daevas are servants of the Daevic Heptad and the Destructive Spirit. The Daevas of Frost and Snow are heralds of bad weather and frozen death.
