Al-Malik al-Aswad, the Black King, was once an Ifrit Sultan of extraordinary might. When he claimed the City of Brass as his, the other Sultans challenged him and finally banished him from all the lands of Ubar. He fled into the ocean, as other rebellious Afarit had done. As an exiled usurper he was referred to as the king of Marids. But now, with the awakening, he has asked for forgiveness and been granted absolution by the God of Ubar.
