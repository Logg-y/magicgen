The vila is a powerful female spirit of the wild. The cloud vila appears as a naked, winged woman with cloud-like hair. Her beauty is only marred by her hoofed feet and anyone rude enough to mention this fact will be struck down or cursed for the rest of his life. The cloud vila can fascinate and lure men into servitude with her spellsongs and otherworldly beauty. She has the power to give and take health, but is also a powerful mage of the Air who wields lightning and rides the storms. The cloud vila is not as skilled in healing as the mountain vila.
