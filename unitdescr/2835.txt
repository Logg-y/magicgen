The Kabeiroi were human craftsmen of ancient Therodos taught by the Daktyloi. Secretive like their masters they formed guilds that required new members to advance through mystical initiation. Many of the rituals include prodigious drinking and the Kabeiroi were sometimes expelled from cities due to their practices. The Kabeiroi guilds spread to coastal cities and their craftsmanship was sought after by the kings of men. With the cataclysmic fall of Therodos the guilds were destroyed and their members dispersed. But a few of them survived, and now, with the return of the Lord, the Kabeiroi of the ancient guilds have returned to serve their old masters.
