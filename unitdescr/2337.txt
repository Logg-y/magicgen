Spectral armies roam the Underworld, re-enacting the battles that consumed their mortal lives. Now they have been interrupted from their eternal wars and brought back to fight the living. Spectral legionnaires are ethereal. Their weapons are not of this world and will not wound those strong of mind. When alive the Triarii were handpicked old veterans entrusted to set an example and keep fighting even against the most fearsome enemies.
